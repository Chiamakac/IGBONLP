Mbanefo said that plans were on the way to commission Ogbunike cave in 2020.
A new Court of Appeal Division, the 18th in the series has been inaugurated in Awka, the Anambra State capital.
The milestone achievement is coming after 29 years of the state’s to provide easy and timely access to justice for people of Anambra and environs.
Inaugurating the new Appeal Court Complex at Court Road, Awka, Gov.
Willie Obiano of Anambra said it was consistent with his administration''s efforts to give the Judiciary a pride of place in the state and to bring justice closer to Ndi Anambra.'
The Governor noted that the establishment of the court would reduce risks faced by lawyers and litigants, who had been to travel to and fro Enugu in search of justice.
According to him 70 per cent of the cases at the court in Enugu emanated from Anambra, stressing that the cases will now be transferred to Anambra State for easy dispensation of justice.
``The importance of this day can easily be seen in the imperatives of justice to a society that desires growth, freedom and democracy.
``Indeed, no progressive society can experience rapid growth without the stabilising presence of robust institutions of which the Judiciary is one.
``Therefore, as our beloved state expands to accommodate the growth in our democratic culture, in the economy and in social life generally, it becomes important that we establish the organs that will help to keep the society on its toes,’’ Gov.
Obiano stressed.
President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa earlier said the Nigerian Judiciary acknowledged the enormous need to bring justice closer to the people, hence the continued creation of more divisions to ensure faster justice delivery.
She commended the determination of Gov.
Willie Obiano in making the project a reality.
Acting Chief Judge of Anambra State, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu maintained that the establishment of the court Anambra State would bring relief to teeming litigants in Anambra State and their counsels.
Anyachebelu noted that prior to this date, people travel to Enugu to have their appeals heard.
According to Anyachebelu, going by statistics the cases and the guiding principles of bringing Justice nearer to the people, I think Anambra state deserves a division of the court of Appeal.
``I am aware that the honourable president of the Court of Appeal has posted a panel of three distinguished `Nobel Lords of the Court of Appeal’ to kick-start the onerous judicial work in the Awka Division.
``It is good for a start, but I know that based on volume of cases waiting for attention of the Awka division, two panels of five justices are needed to truly deal with the work of the Court of Appeal in Anambra State.

Dr Nwankwo, 77, died Feb.
1 at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Ituku Ozala, Enugu State, after a brief illness.
A statement in Awka Feb.
2, the Anambra State Commissioner for Information, Mr C Don Adinuba, described Dr Nwankwo’s passage as at once painful and glorious.
``Painful because Nwankwo was one of the few people in the world who should never die,’’ Adinuba said.
``Glorious because he was able to achieve so much for not just his country but also humanity.
``He was a most accomplished publisher, poet, novelist, historian, political scientist, pan Africanist, activist and fighter for justice.
``Worried about the dearth of indigenous publishing firms in Africa in the early 1970s, Dr Nwankwo, together with Dr Sam Ifejika, with whom he co-authored a popular book on the Nigerian Civil War in 1969, established a firm named Nwamife Publishers Ltd in Enugu.
They published not only books on the war but also works by such scintillating scholars as Prof.
Ben Nwabueze, Africa’s most influential scholar of constitutional law.
``With Dr Ifejika’s relocation to Canada, Dr Nwankwo started his own personal firm, Fourth Dimension Publishers, also in Enugu, in the late 1980s.
``Fourth Dimension published almost two thousand highly respected books in various genres, ranging from fiction to literary criticism to history to religion to philosophy to political science to sociology to poetry to physical and biological sciences to autobiography to law and so on.
``It was, indeed, a thing of honour for scholars around Africa to be published by Fourth Dimension.
And through Fourth Dimension, many academics attained the professorial rank in the universities.
``The Anambra State Government recognises Dr Nwankwo as a foremost fighter for social justice.
He said that Anambra established the first Task Force on Guinea Worm Control in 1986.
He returned to Nigeria from the US after studies at Eastern Mennonite College in West Virginia and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, as the Nigerian political crisis was starting in the late 1960s.
He could have returned to America or travelled elsewhere, but he chose to stay with his people with all the sufferings and deprivations and deaths of that era.
``He was at loggerheads with different governments which saw him incarcerated more than once.
He was a natural member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) which saw him address critical audiences around the world on the Nigerian condition under the military dictatorship.
He was to pay a price for all this.
``Dr Nwankwo was a statesman through and through.
``The Canter Centre joined the elimination project in 1989 as the Programme continued with vertical intervention approach.
Willie Obiano thanks the Nwankwo family for keeping in touch with his government in the last few weeks of their leader.
``We condole with the Nwankwo family of Ajalli in Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State on the passage of this remarkable writer, publisher, social crusader and pan Africanist.
May the Lord receive his soul.
``Not less than 16 Local Government Areas were found to be hyper endemic and Meso – endemic for River Blindness.

According to the judge, INEC should be put on notice.     However, in the ruling delivered on Tuesday, the Judge upheld the preliminary objection filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the court could not assume or exercise jurisdiction over such matters, as it is the duty of the Election Petition Tribunal.

BREAKING: INEC Set To Announce Timetable For Governorship Elections In Kogi, Bayelsa
The Kogi State governorship election had held earlier, on November 22, 2015, but it was also declared inconclusive, necessitating a rerun, at the end of which Yahaya Bello of the APC was declared winner after securing 247,752 votes while Idris Wada, the incumbent Governor and PDP candidate, polled 204,877 votes. It wasn't Bello who on the election in practice, though; he was only declared winner, being the runner-up in the APC primary, following the death of Abubakar Audu, the authentic candidate of the party, on November 22, 2015.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says the schedule of activities for the governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states, slated for later in 2019, will be released during the week.
Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the INEC Chairman, stated this on Monday when he appeared before a joint session of the Senate Committee on INEC and House Committee on Electoral matters to defend INEC’s 2019 budget proposal.
According to Yakubu, the total figure for the Commission’s 2019 budget proposal is N45.4billion.
Addressing the committee, he said: “This year, we are going to conduct two end-of-tenure elections into the offices of the governors in Kogi and Bayelsa States.
“Let me seize this opportunity here to say before the end of this week, INEC will issue a timetable and schedule of activities for the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states.
“For 2019, we were presented with an envelope of N45.5billion as our regular budget. This is the same envelope as in 2018, only slightly better than the envelopes of several years before them.
“In 2017, it was N45billion; in 2016, it was N45billion, and in 2018, it was increased marginally to N45.5billion and the same envelope was presented to the Commission in 2018 and 2019. I will say for the 2018 financial year we were fully funded. We were on the first line charge, so in terms of the releases from the executive to the Commission, we were fully funded."
Giving a breakdown of the budget items, he continued: "The first one is personnel cost and in 2019; the commission is proposing the sum of N21.8billion to cover consolidated salaries for 16,455 career employees of INEC and 51 political office holders, making a total of 16,506 employees of the commission in 2019. “The personnel cost is broken into two subheads. You have the consolidated salary of N17.5billion and you have the social contribution, National Health Insurance, contributory pension, and employee compensation of N4.3billion.”
Noting that the overhead cost is N4.2billion, while the third budget head is for electoral expenditure, he added: “The Commission is proposing the sum of N17.7 billion under the electoral expenditure to cover such activities as monitoring party primaries, conventions, voter education, stakeholder meeting legal expenses and others."
N1.6billion was proposed to cover capital expenditure.

BREAKING: INEC Suspends Further Action On Inconclusive Imo North Senatorial Election
In February, two days after the INEC office in Isiala Mbano Local Government Area in Imo North Senatorial District was set ablaze by persons suspected to be political thugs, INEC declared the senatorial election inconclusive, citing allegations of ballot box snatching, kidnapping of electoral officers and manipulation of the process.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it is suspending “all further proceedings and actions” on the Imo North senatorial election, which it earlier declared inconclusive in March.
According to Mallam Mohammed Haruna, National Commissioner and Member, Information and Voter Education Committee, INEC made the decision in compliance with an ex-parte order mandating it to do so.
“Further to our statement of 4th April 2019 on the setting up of a committee by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to investigate the veracity or otherwise of allegations of misconduct in the Imo North Senatorial Election, the Commission wishes to inform the public that the Committee has completed its assignment," the commission said in a statement.
“However, the Commission has been served with an ex-parte order halting further action on the matter.

BREAKING: PDP Leading APC By A Mile As Adamawa Supplementary Election Winds Down
Thursday's rerun is holding in 44 polling units in 28 registration areas of the state. After results from 16 of the 44 polling units, Fintiri has further extended his lead by close to 3,000 votes, polling 3,271 against Bindow's 719.
Ahmed Umar Fintiri, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is in a comfortable lead over incumbent Governor Jibrilla Bindow of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the ongoing Adamawa State supplementary governorship election, according to results seen so far by SaharaReporters.
Before the March 9 election was declared inconclusive, Fintiri had polled 367,471 votes while Bindow had 334,995, meaning he was leading by a margin of 32,476 votes — quite healthy considering that ballots cancelled for various infractions amounted to just 40,988.
It also meant Fintiri needs to lose by a margin of roughly less than 8,00 votes to emerge winner of the election.
Thursday's rerun is holding in 44 polling units in 28 registration areas of the state. After results from 16 of the 44 polling units, Fintiri has further extended his lead by close to 3,000 votes, polling 3,271 against Bindow's 719.
As of the time of filing in this report, voting had ended in all polling units and unofficial collation of results already ongoing.
BREAKING: PDP's Fintiri Unseats Incumbent APC Governor Bindow In Adamawa
To emerge victor, FIntiri polled a total of 376,552 votes to beat Jibrilla Bindow, incumbent Governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who secured 336,386 votes, amounting to a margin of 40,166.
Ahmed Umar Fintiri, candidate of the peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has won the Adamawa State governorship election.
To emerge victor, FIntiri polled a total of 376,552 votes to beat Jibrilla Bindow, incumbent Governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who secured 336,386 votes, amounting to a margin of 40,166.
Before Thursday's supplementary election, Fintiri had polled 367,471 votes while Bindow had 334,995, leaving a margin of 32,476 votes and placing him in a quite comfortable situation, as only 40,988 votes were cancelled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
Bindow might have harboured faint hopes of catching up with his adversary, but it was Fintiri who went even better, further widening the gap after polling 9,081 votes at the supplementary exercise to Bidow's 1,391.
Governor-elect Fintiri is a former Adamawa State Governor whose reign remains one of the most short-lived ever in Nigeria's history.
He was Speaker of the Adamawa State House of Assembly in July 2014 when Murtala Nyako was impeached as Governor. With his deputy, Bala Ngilari, having supposedly resigned just before the impeachment, Fintiri became Acting Governor for the three months within which the law mandated the conduct of a by-election.
He was the favourite to win the resultant by-election. However, three days before the election, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja invalidated Ngilari's supposed resignation, saying it didn't follow the appropriate channel as it wasn't Nyako who accepted it. Consequently, it forbade the conduct of the election and ordered the swearing in of Ngilari as Governor.
In a twist of fate, when Fintiri secured the PDP ticket in last year's primary, he polled 1,656 votes to beat Abubakar Waziri, former Chief Protocol Officer to former president Goodluck Jonathan, who polled 465 votes, as well as Ngilari, who could only muster 76 votes.

Brymo: The Preacher Without A Church
Brymo — the wizard as he chooses to call himself — has now become the prophet many people seek for advice, because his melody and lyrics bring peace to troubled souls.
In 1998, Fela’s album titled ‘Music is the weapon of the future’ was released. For many reasons, the title of the album read varying meanings for different people. Twenty years down the line,
Flash forward to 2018, twenty years later, music has not only become the 'weapon', it is now more or less the must-have ‘weapon’ of many people.
To the left, a little child is being driven to sleep by a lullaby from a doll; to the right, a depressed man is being taught how to smile again by the lyrics of a soulful music; downtown, a hustler’s dream is being fuelled by the beats from fast-track music. And in the ivory towers, the beauty of wealth is celebrated with royalty music. Music not just only a weapon, it has now become a culture.
Olawale Ashimi, more popularly known as Brymo, is one man who has grown from that commercial artist trying to score a hit so the heavy money-pumping brands won’t run to another artist, to that artist whose voice, melody and rhyme finds its way to the loneliest and deepest part of emotions. He is one of the very few whose music would make many listeners take a pen and jotter to write down the words of wisdom coming from his songs. He did not just jump out of the blues into the music space; he had to journey through some burning flames to become who he is today.
How it started
Born on May 9, 1986 in Okokomaiko, a suburb in Lagos, to an Awori carpenter and an Egun trader, Olawale Ashimi, who loves to be called Olawale Olofo’ro, better known as Brymo started making music in secondary school in 1999. The Lagos State University drop-out released his first song which he titled ‘Future’. Growing up as the neighbourhood ‘wahala pikin’, Brymo initially had dreams of playing football but had wake up from that when he listened to his mother sing fuji, and he was inspired to make music.
After dropping his football dream for music, in 2002, he and some of his friends came together to form a musical group called ‘The Aliens’. However, after struggling with some issues in 2004 and 2005, the group parted ways. And with this, Brymo became a solo artist. Eight years after dropping his first song, in 2007, Brymo dropped his debut album ‘Brymstone’. Upon release of the album, according to him he sold 2,000 copies within the first six months and the album got him a marketing deal of N1 million, which did not work out.
The son of a carpenter vs Chocolate City
If Brymo decides to write a biography tomorrow, one page that won’t be missing from his story is his journey through the four walls of Chocolate City, the record label that brought him from obscurity to spotlight after he signed a record deal with the label in 2010.
After blessing Ice Prince with vocals to his hit single ‘Oleku’, on September 18, 2011 Brymo released his second album lead single ‘Ara’ which was produced by Legendary Beats. His sophomore album ‘The Son of A Carpenter’ was released on November 23, 2012 with features from Jesse Jagz, Pryse, M.I. and Ice Prince. Speaking on the album, Brymo said inspiration for the album came as a result of his father’s occupation as a carpenter.
Speaking in an interview with omojuwa,com, he said: “I titled it so, because my father is a carpenter. I was only trying to tell my story and pass a message that irrespective of our backgrounds, we can always be whatever we want to be. I was one of those kids who used to think my parents did not do enough. When I was younger, I was ashamed of my background but thank God, today, I am proud of my parents. I’m proud of Okokomaiko, the neighbourhood, where I grew up and I am proud of my achievements.”
However, while fans were still savouring the album, the singer announced via twitter that he had left Chocolate City just after one month Jesse Jagz, a fellow singer, left. When the news first broke, the record label denied the news saying the singer still had three years left on his contract. Speaking on Brymo’s leaving, Audu Makori, the President of Chocolate City, told Premium Times that “It’s a very clear case of breach of contract and it is in court. If an artiste feels that he is aggrieved, even within the contract, there is a mechanism to resolve issues. When you fail to honour your contract and you abandon it feeling that you have a right, the contract empowers you to go to court and that’s what has happened.”
“We had a discussion at Chocolate City’s office in Lekki in December 2012, when he told me I can leave the label. I was not happy with the way I was being treated by the label and we agreed to stop working together. He was to give me a document to that effect but he later changed his mind,” Brymo told the court in 2014.
Brymo would later tell Toolz in an interview in 2016 that the label and him “had the opportunity to iron it out in court but they fried it up. I don’t know what they did but they definitely spoke to the judge and spoke to the lawyers and scrapped the case. They are lawyers; they can do it”.
Life goes on
With what happened, one’s best prediction would have been that the end of the son of carpenter’s musical career was probably in sight. However, he has not disappointed the world by going into oblivion as per expectations. He remained strong honing his craft and went on to subsequently drop an album.
‘Tabularasa’, an 11-track album was released on October 30, 2014 after his controversial split with his former record label. According to the singer, he got the title for the album after he heard the judge handling his case against his label use it. The album contains tracks like ‘1 Pound’; ‘Je’le O Sinmi’ and ‘Prick No Get shoulder’. The album contains a detailed explanation of the singer’s troubles, joys and the shape his art would take in the nearest future. Songs like ‘Dear Child’ tells children the dangers of being impatient and anxious.
The lyrics to the song read: “Grandma was a very good old lady. She tried and died working to feed her grown babies. From dusk to dawn, she laboured for more. Nothing was okay. Nothing was ever enough. She say time go heal everything, because time go kill everything. She said a lifetime is enough time; Say if you take time you go fit to make time.”
Not done yet, the following year, he released an eight-track album which he titled ‘Trance’. The album was released by American record label, Tate Music Group.
According to Brymo, the album is a “a medley of thoughts based on his experiences”. On May 9, 2016, the now refined Brymo draped his fifth studio album ‘Klitoris’. Esse Kakada, Brymo’s girlfriend, was the only feature on the album. Explaining the reason behind the title, the artiste said: “The album is the key to a certain door I have knocked on for years; and yes it was meant to be sensual. There ought to be two sides to the coin".
And then in 2018, the singer released his sixth studio album, which he titled ‘Oso’, a Yoruba word which mean ‘The Wizard’. The album received critical acclaim. A single off the album, ‘Banuso’ is Brymo’s latest musical project which touches on the importance of “communing with one’s heartland not with mere men”.
The video, which was brilliantly directed by Victor Adewale, a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University showed Brymo embracing minimalism by being the only feature in the video.
Brymo — the wizard as he chooses to call himself — has now become the prophet many people seek for advice, because his melody and lyrics bring peace to troubled souls.
Brymo is the preacher without a church with a spice of philosophy. His music stands tall in the confines of providing therapy.

We're Not Joined In Suit Against Kalu, Sun Management Says After EFCC Marks Premises
The EFCC had said it obtained a court order in the case against ex-governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, to takeover companies belonging to him as well as Slok Ltd.
PM News
The Sun Publishing Limited has denounced the invasion of its premises by officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission allegedly carrying out an order of the court.
The EFCC had said it obtained a court order in the case against ex-governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, to takeover companies belonging to him as well as Slok Ltd.
The EFCC explained that it marked the property to prevent it from being sold.
Reacting to the move by the EFCC, management of Sun in a statement said there was no legal basis for the takeover, adding that the company was not joined in the suit against Kalu.
It stated further that there was a "pending appeal at the Supreme Court calling for a stay of action pending the hearing of the motion for stay of execution and the appeal".
The statement reads partly, "The EFCC officials wrote on The Sun's fence, 'EFCC, keep off'.
They also advised our staff to collect their personal belongings from the office as they will come back to seal the premises completely.     We do not understand the legal basis for this action.
It is on record that there is a pending appeal at the Supreme Court with suit no: SC/546/2018 wherein The Sun Publishing Limited appealed against the judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal on the interim forfeiture order made against it by a Federal High Court in 2007 based on ex-parte proceeding.     The notice of appeal and motion for stay of execution were duly served on EFCC by the bailiffs of the court.
Again, it is instructive to state that The Sun Publishing Limited was not a party to the case of EFCC vs Orji Uzor Kalu and two others, so we do not see why the judgment in that case should lead to an attempt to seal The Sun Publishing Limited premises.     Furthermore, we are aware that both Senator Orji Uzor Kalu and Slok Nig Limited have since appealed the judgment delivered by Justice Mohammed Idris and a hearing date given.
We wish to reiterate that The Sun Publishing Limited is an ongoing corporate limited liability company and its shares are owned by various individuals distinct from Senator Kalu.     Therefore, the recent judgment against Senator Kalu should not be used to disturb the operations of the company and the proprietary rights of its innocent shareholders until the matters are dispensed with at the Supreme Court."
We’ll Reclaim Our Stolen Mandate, Says Rivers AAC Gov Candidate
“I want Rivers people, especially my teeming supporters, who are being pained by what they are seeing, to keep hope alive. Victory is certain. We are going to bring back the stolen mandate,” Awara said.
Biokpomabo Awara, governorship candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in Rivers State, says his party will reclaim the “stolen mandate”, referring to his loss in the election.
He alleged gross irregularities in the resumed collation of the state governorship election result that saw Nyesom Wike of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) reelected as Governor of the state.
Wike won the election after polling 886,264 votes to beat Awara, who polled 173,859 votes. The margin was 712,405 votes.
However, Awara said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) connived with Wike to rig him out of winning the election.
Speaking after the announcement of the result, Awara alleged that Lawrence Chuku, his party agent, was denied access to the collation centre.
Awara said: “Nenye Kocha is not the collation agent of AAC in INEC office, Port Harcourt. Dr. Chuku is the duly-nominated collation agent of AAC, but he was prevented by security personnel at the gate of INEC’s office in Port Harcourt from moving to the collation centre.
“I have the unit by unit results of the March 9, 2019 elections in Rivers State. When they observed that I was leading and they saw the danger coming, they quickly moved on March 10 to save Wike, by suspending the collation of the results, which they resumed on April 1. As at the time the collation was suspended, I had 281,000 votes, as against Wike’s 79,000 votes. So, they (INEC officials) quickly came to his rescue.
“We have written a petition on the electoral fraud in Rivers State to the INEC chairman, stating the actual results, but Professor Yakubu will not take action.”
He urged his supporters to remain calm stating that the result would be challenged and he would “reclaim the stolen mandate”.
“I want Rivers people to be calm. We are going to reclaim the stolen mandate. We should not be troubled and we should never opt for violence.
“I want Rivers people, especially my teeming supporters, who are being pained by what they are seeing, to keep hope alive. Victory is certain. We are going to bring back the stolen mandate,” Awara said.

In 1929 pipe borne water was introduced in Kano. At that time, many other parts of Northern Nigeria were large swathe of bush. According to historical records from Alkali Hussaini Sufi’s book “Musan Kammu”, after network of water supply were connected in the city pipes, colonial administrators noticed that people still patronise unhygienic water from wells and ponds. People show no interest in using water from taps. Subtle public enlightenment was carried out – but nothing changed. More public enlightenment was rigorously carried out. People across Kano city started making up a lot bizarre stories about the dangers of drinking pipe borne water “ruwan famfo.” Conspiracy theories kept flying around mosques, homes and markets.
One, the theories was that drinking or using pipe borne water reduces one’s faith in Allah. Some even said that patronising pipe borne water can get one into a tangle with ‘aljanu.’ Colonial administrators kept pushing - and went further by connecting homes with pipe borne water free of charge. Despite that, the suspicion towards pipe borne water spread across the ancient city. Again, colonial administrators went a step further by sand-filling wells in neighbourhoods and homes where pipe borne water was connected. For us, in this age, this may sound strange. After all, everywhere you go now people are yearning for pipe borne water, but it is nowhere to be found. Taps have been dry for decades in many cities and towns.
In education, the suspicion was even steeper. Western education was greeted with rejection and deadly conspiracy theories ranging from tendency to render one from a believer to a disbeliever. Some even claimed that ‘ilimin Boko’ (western education) is the shortest route to hellfire. While some emirs sent their sons to western education schools, others sent sons of slaves and concubines to such schools – perhaps to test the waters. In many cases, they only started enrolling their own children when they found out sons of slaves with education are acquiring power and influence. Here we are now, in the age that parents go extra miles to educate their children. Many want their children to be educated but there are not enough schools, or the cost of education is ridiculously unaffordable for many families. Where there are schools available, they are dilapidated, classes are crowded, with teachers that have no capacity to impart knowledge or shape character. In fact, the teachers themselves, in many cases, need education not jobs in the education sector.
The point here is, every society and people as individuals tend to resist change. It is human. There are so many reasons for this. New things always generate questions that turn into suspicion. People, as human beings always want to conform – to stick with the familiar. We want to do things as our ancestors did. We want to stay within the realm of society’s expectations, culture and traditions, often to the detriment of existence. People are still afraid and suspicious of people who are not from their tribes or their geographical origin. People are still suspicious of people of different faith. They trust only their own. They are afraid of many things, including new faces. People still want to look at issues and interpret them according to the endorsement of the society. People are scared to ask questions.
‘Fear’ is at the centre of it all. Not many people can take the risk of being different. Not many want to chart new path. In societies like this, a year comes and go in the same way. As the writer VS Naipaul puts it; “…the year ends as it begins…” Every year, as far as memory can recall, cholera kills dozens of men, women and children. The number of deaths every year as a result of cholera suggest that there was no concrete plan to mitigate its risks. No lasting solution or even new approach of addressing poor sanitation and the lack of portable water supply that cause outbreak of cholera every year – yes, it is like an annual festival of death. Whenever the hottest season is here from around March, April to May there will be outbreak of meningitis – every year. Hundreds of children will die – they die every year – since before the age of vaccines. This year too meningitis killed many children. These diseases have a strong relationship with poverty. Above all, these diseases continue to kill children annually. We just helplessly wait for the bad news to come and go. Critical thinking or research can minimise these painful deaths of children. Strategic public enlightenment on hygiene and then enough vaccines can make a lot of difference. At least, with proactive measures the risks of deaths of children can be minimised every year.
The world is changing at a speed. Those who could not catch up are those who could not change.

Who Advises Aisha Buhari; The Angry Matron Of The Villa? By Fredrick Nwabufo
Is Aisha Buhari ‘’calamity first lady’’? Really, I ask because she appears to reveal all the dirty and soiled undergarments of the villa to the chagrin of President Muhammadu Buhari.
Fredrick Nwabufo
Jane Appleton Pierce, the wife of Franklin Pierce, 14th president of the United States, is perhaps, most remembered as the ‘’calamity first lady’’. She spent her years working against the political ambition of her husband. And when he eventually became president she still did not let up.
Is Aisha Buhari ‘’calamity first lady’’? Really, I ask because she appears to reveal all the dirty and soiled undergarments of the villa to the chagrin of President Muhammadu Buhari.
In October, in the heat of the controversy effectuated by an interview granted by Fatima Mamman Daura, daughter of the ‘’cabal honcho’’ to sully Aisha, I expressed concern regarding the knotty problem the first lady was dealing with at the villa.
To me, it was clear Mamman Daura’s daughter leaked the video recording of Aisha in her most distressed state to embarrass her.
Also, I considered it duplicitous that the ‘’cabal’’ was in conflict with the first lady and at the same time cozying up to the president and huddling in his kitchen.
I had asked: Can the cabal love the president more than his wife? Can they be for the president but against his wife? Does loyalty not come with full compliments? Is disloyalty to the wife of the president, loyalty to the president?
I believe the president and his wife share intimacy by dint of marriage. She is naturally his biggest influencer; whispering sweet ‘’nothings and somethings’’ in his ear during pillow talk.
But as a matter of fact, Aisha is now coming off as an angry black first lady. Her concerns as regards her family affairs, may or may not be genuine, but she has become catty in handling them.
The office of the first lady is a pivotal one. It should bring the zing to the administration. It should be that ‘’soft and cuddly touch’’ of the administration. The office should also be the staunchest promoter of the government and not an outlet for exhibiting hypocritical tigritude.
At the weekend, the first lady accused presidential aides of not ‘’defending the government’’ enough.
According to her, ‘’aides are supposed to take action against the offenders, or to take action or to take charge or be in control, or caution people, they keep mute. But when it comes to unnecessary things, people will start talking from the presidency.”
I find this amusing. Aisha herself has been the biggest demarketer of the administration. I will give instances.
In May, the first lady ridiculed the N500 billion social investment programme initiated by her husband’s government. She said it failed in the north.
Hear her: “I was expecting the N500bn to be utilised in different methods in the north for the aim to be achieved. I don’t know the method they used, but most of the northern states do not get it. My state does not get it.’’
In October, 2016, Aisha said she might not support Buhari’s re-election -- that he is a titular head being puppeteered by three people – the cabal.
In November at the National Islamic Council meeting in Abuja, she spared no verbal attack for anyone, cutting down every organ and institution of government with her tongue.
But is it the place of the first lady to reprimand aides appointed by the president in the open? Do they report to her? Were they appointed by her?
I am really concerned. Does Aisha really know how government functions? Beyond her criticisms of the administration, which I must say resonate with me as a critic, she appears to be classically ignorant of the operations of government.
Really, Aisha has shaped up to be that lady of the manor who commands obedience by heckling, cursing and caterwauling.
I saw through the veneer of her hypocrisy when she spoke in support of the draconian social media bill. According to her, the first family ought to be protected from the irritations of social media.
She even reprimanded Lai Mohammed, minister of information, in public for not taking action on those she conceived to be offenders on social media. It was clear to me that her attacks, even on the administration, were for an insular end – not that she loved the people.
I advise Aisha, the matron of the villa, to take lessons in grace, temperance and carriage from Michelle Obama, former first lady of the US.
She could also choose to see a role model in the late Mariam Babangida.

Wig-wearing Women Get Ready: Tanzania To Impose Wig, Hair Extension Tax
Supporters of the levy say it will help women keep their hair natural. But there has also been public outrage, with women saying they are being punished for wanting to look good in wigs and hair extensions.

DHgate
A row has broken out in Tanzania over the government's decision to impose a tax on wigs and hair extensions.
Many male and some female MPs applauded and thumped their desks in approval when Finance Minister Philip Mpango announced the tax in parliament.
Supporters of the levy say it will help women keep their hair natural.
But there has also been public outrage, with women saying they are being punished for wanting to look good in wigs and hair extensions.
Tanzanians tend to uphold traditional values, but society is changing and many women now wear wigs and extensions, the BBC's Aboubakar Famau reports from the capital, Dodoma.
In his budget speech in parliament on Thursday, Mr. Mpango announced a 25% tax on imported wigs and hair extensions and a 10% tax on those made locally as part of a series of measures aimed at increasing government revenue.
The cheapest wigs currently costs around $4 (£3.40), but they can sell for up to $130.
Mr. Mpango also scrapped the exemption on value-added tax placed on sanitary towels, saying consumers had not benefited as businesses did not reduce prices when it was introduced
Xenophobia: Nigeria Boycotts World Economic Forum In South Africa
Meanwhile, the Nigerian Government has said it is considering the next line of actions to take concerning the attacks on its citizen by South African xenophobes.
Nigeria has boycotted the World Economic Forum beginning in South Africa today.
Other countries like Rwanda, Malawi and DR Congo were also absent at the forum due to the recent xenophobic attacks on African migrants in South Africa.
Meanwhile, the Nigerian Government has said it is considering the next line of actions to take concerning the attacks on its citizen by South African xenophobes.
A post on Twitter on Wednesday by the Nigerian Government, stated that President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, were meeting to discuss the next line of action on the attacks on Nigerians in the former apartheid nation.
The tweet reads, “President @MBuhari, Vice President @ProfOsinbajo and Foreign Affairs Minister @GeoffreyOnyeama met this morning to discuss @NigeriaGov’s next steps in response to the attacks against Nigerians in South Africa. Updates later.”
Xenophobia: Nigerian Shop Owners At Lekki Shoprite Lament Losses After Reprisal Looting
One trader, who asked not to be named, said, “They should please help us, let the management verify our identities. I am very bitter --they looted everything and not one thing is remaining in my shop.
Shop owners at the Shoprite outlet at Jakande, Lekki in Lagos, are counting their losses after an angry mob stormed the place and looted several times.
During a visit to the place on Wednesday, SaharaReporters came across embittered shop owners, who claimed to have lost their entire wares as a result of the invasion of the mall by the irate mob.
One trader, who asked not to be named, said, “They should please help us, let the management verify our identities. I am very bitter --they looted everything and not one thing is remaining in my shop.
“They assured us that nothing will happen, this morning I went there and everything in my shop is gone.”
A salesgirl with a popular restaurant identified as Beauty, said, “They sent a text message for us to come but why are they not letting us in. This is really terrible because our businesses have been affected.”
Disenchanted Nigerians took to the streets on Tuesday and Wednesday to protest and retaliate xenophobic attacks on Nigerians living in South Africa by destroying businesses with connection to South Africans.
On Tuesday, one person was shot dead by the police in the ensuing chaos that greeted the Shoprite outlet in Jakande.
Xenophobia: Punish Attackers, Group Urges International Community

“We commend the Nigerian Government for drawing the ‘red line’ and making adequate efforts to bring back Nigerians who are willing to return home immediately.
“We call on the international community to add their voice to the condemnation of this heinous act and bring perpetrators to justice.”
You Can Call Me Prostitute In Business -Aremu Afolayan Nigerian Filmmaker
“I am a businessman, and you can actually refer to me as a prostitute
in business. I sell cars, clothes, wrist watches, and many other
things."
Aremu Afolayan, an actor and filmmaker, has slammed at the critics whohave tagged him a gigolo.In an interview with Scoop Sunday, the actor, who is a brother toKunle Afolayan, a Nollywood producer, said if his critics got theexposure and opportunity, they had been a gigolo.He said being in a relationship with an older person does not mean hegets financial benefit from it.Afolayan said, “That is an old gist, and I really don’t want to talkabout it. But, even if I am doing that, it is nobody’s business. I amsure (the people talking, would) also want to do that (if they had theopportunity).“I am a businessman, and you can actually refer to me as a prostitutein business. I sell cars, clothes, wrist watches, and many otherthings. Dating someone older than one is different from someone olderpaying one’s bills. I don’t think there is anything wrong in dating ormarrying someone older than one.”He also debunked assumptions that Nollywood actresses engage inprostitution or sex for roles.On why actresses seemed to fare better than actors in the industry,Afolayan said, “Most people have a side business. Even many Hollywoodcelebrities have side businesses. One problem, though, is that somepeople live up to certain expectations that nobody is even asking themto in the first place."But ordinarily, both male and female actors should be making so muchmoney that they should be the one sponsoring politicians, and not theother way round.”
“All Over The World, Everybody Is Gbeseing Now”, Osinbajo Says In Apparent Praise Of Nigerian Dance Steps
The excited VP reeled out the names of various popular dance moves by Nigerian artistes to an enthusiastic gathering in a video seen by SaharaReporters.
Nigeria’s Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, has praised the country’s young musicians and the many dance steps they help to innovate.
The excited VP reeled out the names of various popular dance moves by Nigerian artistes to an enthusiastic gathering in a video seen by SaharaReporters.
Dishing out the name of one dance step to another to the admiration of the packed gathering, Osinbajo said that “all over the world, everybody is ‘gbeseing’ now”.
‘Gbese’ is a popular dance step featured in many Nigerian music videos where dancers are seen momentarily jumping and lifting their legs away from the floor as if they are delivery a strong kick with the under of their legs.
In the video the Vice President said, “From Skelewu to Sekem, Shakitibobo, Shaku-shaku and to the most recent Zanku, I am sure you all know how to ‘Gbese’, ‘Gbe body eee’.
“So, all over the world, everybody is gbeseing now.”
Over the years, Nigerian musicians have been known to invent eye-catching dance moves that not only become big hits in the country but also in other parts of the world.
The National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM) has trained over 100 middle-aged women drawn from the 36 states on how to turn agricultural waste into wealth.
The training, held in Ilorin, Kwara State, involves how the outputs of one agricultural sector could be used as inputs of another towards a leap in Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Products (GDP).
According to the Executive Director of NCAM, Dr. Yomi Kasali: “It is part of our mandate to fabricate and design both high level machines and low ones for the agricultural needs of farmers.
“Besides, before we designed, we must have a focus on what we intend to achieve with our designs. We have machines at present that can turn waste products from our poultry, piggery and snail rearing into useful materials for agrarian purposes. These machines need just little skills, which we intend to impact in our women farmers, picked across the nation.’’
Kasali, who described women as more patient and adaptable to training, said they are more willing to spread knowledge gained among themselves than their male counterparts.
The NCAM boss while canvassing more incentives to mechanised farming noted that arguably, the sector combined with industrialisation remained the largest employer of labour the world over.Kasali while advising the trainees, urged them to see themselves as ambassadors of the Federal Government on the need to diversify the nation’s economy, premised on proceeds from crude oil.He promised donations of starter packs to all the participants by NCAM, at the end of the training.
[FILE PHOTO] Emmanuel Onwubiko, National Co-ordinator OF HURIWAA Pro-democracy and non-governmental organisation, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has condemned the reported ban from travelling for the 2019 election by Igbo speaking Nigerians resident in the 19 Northern states as disclosed by a socio-cultural club – Igbo Delegates Assembly (IDA) in Kaduna.
[FILE PHOTO] Emmanuel Onwubiko, National Co-ordinator OF HURIWA
HURIWA accused the socio-cultural club of displaying either crass ignorance of the constitutional tenets on fundamental freedoms including freedom of movement or the group may simply be playing the political game of some persons who are totally confused anarchists who pay no heed to the constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.
In a media statement signed by the National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, yesterday, in Abuja, against the backdrop of the story in circulation about a purported ban from travelling to the South East from the 19 Northern states for purposes of the 2019 polls, HURIWA said such a brazen disrespect to the provisions of the constitution is an affront to civilization and must be disregarded by all right thinking free citizens of Nigeria.
HURIWA also reminded the authors of the illegal ban that their public notice amounted to a breach of the section 42 (1) of the constitution, which prohibits discrimination since all other ethnic nationalities cannot come under such a blanket ban that is absolutely illegal and unconstitutional.
Specifically, section 42 (1) states thus: “A citizen of Nigeria of a particular community, ethnic group, place of origin, sex, religion or political opinion shall not, by reason only that he is such a person – be subjected either expressly by, or in the practical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any executive or administrative action of the government, to disabilities or restrictions to which citizen of Nigeria of other communities, ethnic groups places of origin, sex, religions or political opinions are not made subject; or be accorded either expressly by, or in the practical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any such executive or administrative action, any privilege or advantage that is not accorded to citizen Nigeria of other communities, ethnic groups, places of origin, sex, religion or political opinions.”
Besides, HURIWA also cited sections 40 and 41 which allow citizens of Nigeria the right to either belong to any association or not and the fundamental right to enjoy freedom of movement.
In Section 40, it is enshrined that “Every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons, and in particular he may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any other association for the protection of his interests.
“Every citizen of Nigeria is entitled to move freely throughout Nigeria and to reside in any part thereof, and no citizen of Nigeria shall be expelled from Nigeria or refused entry thereto or exit therefrom.”
HURIWA however cautioned the group to refrain from imposing extralegal measures against citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria even if they may be registered members of the body just as the rights group said it was inconceivable that in this 21st century a group could come up with such medieval body of rules which absolutely offends the clear provisions of the Nigerian constitution which permits freedom of movement to all Nigerians.

Wah gwaan bredrin, everyting ire?
Ever heard the word “red ibo” in Jamaica? Your suspicion is true, “red ibo” was used to refer to the Igbo slaves in Jamaica because of their light skin.
Jamaica witnessed the influx of the Igbo race between 1790 and 1809 during the transatlantic slave trade.
The modern Igbo race dwelt in the Bight of Biafra in Nigeria. It was from here that the Igbos who were kidnapped and sold as slaves by the Europeans were taken to work on plantations.
During this period, the Igbos, due to their inability to speak the language, introduced some of their words which have now become infused into the Jamaican Patois.
Some of these words include:
Unu– You people
Ima osu (Jamaica) Imu oso (Igbo)- to hiss by sucking your teeth
Akara (Jamaica) Akàrà (Igbo)– bean cake
Soso (Jamaica) Sọsọ (Igbo)- only
Jamaica’s history cannot be discussed without mentioning the influence of the Igbo’s. The Igbo’s influenced the culture, music, the pouring of libation, the “ibo” style, idioms, language and way of life of the Jamaicans. Their yam festival, the Jonkonnu, was introduced by the Igbos. There is a town allegedly named after them, the Ibu Town.
The Jamaicans are akin to the ways of the Igbos such that it is not uncommon to see Jamaicans watch Igbo Nollywood movies. Some of their rural areas take after the Igbo’s in Eastern Nigeria.

Known for their pride, the Igbos are said to have unwritten rules that even the slave owners were made to abide by. Out of this people came individuals who left a mark in that period. A popular example is author, Olaudah Equiano, who was very instrumental in maintaining law and order among the Igbos in Jamaica during the 1776 Mosquito Shore Scheme. He is also regarded as being one of the campaigners of the abolition of slave trade (Google celebrated his 272 birthday last year).
The Igbo slaves were also popular for committing suicides to go back to their homeland. This suicide was what made most slave traders sceptical of having them as slaves.
When they could no longer bear the slavery, 250 Igbo men conspired to kill every white man in the land. Although they failed, their song for freedom cannot be forgotten:
Oh me good friend, Mr Wilberforce, make we free!
God Almighty thank ye! God Almighty thank ye!
God Almighty, make we free!
Buckra in this country no make we free:
What Negro for to do? What Negro for to do?
Take force by force! Take force by force!
ALL
To be sure! to be sure! to be sure!

Tiwa Savage
From being just another girl with a dream doing backup vocals to international artists like George Michael and Mary J. Blige, the ‘African Bad Girl’, Tiwa Savage has grown to be one of the biggest music stars to come out of Africa.
Think of the ingredients that make a superstar and Tiwa Savage has it, chart-topping songs, multiple prestigious awards, sold-out shows both locally and internationally, a loyal fan base, the rich, fabulous and fashionable lifestyle!
The sultry entertainer who relocated to London at the preteen age of 11 returned to Nigeria to pursue a music career. She signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2009, and in 2012, she signed with Mavin Records. In June 2016, Savage signed a management and publishing deal with Roc Nation while in May 2019, she announced her record deal with Universal Music Group and exit from Mavin Records.
Savage’s exit from Mavin Records met with a lot of buzzes with Don Jazzy, the label boss praising her stay with the label. Don Jazzy disclosed that the One crooner was asked to leave Mavin Records four years ago but she chose to stay back and grow the brand.
He further disclosed that his love for her is forever. He says:
“It’s obvious to everybody, it was an epic journey… The business was dope, and she is actually one of my favourite business partners of all time. It was beautiful, she understood from the get-go till now.”
Tiwa Savage
Her signing to Universal Music Group is only the beginning of another journey to musical greatness for Tiwa Savage because she describes it as a learning curve. As opposed to the mentality that signing with an international label means relaxation and taking things slow, she says it is actually the time to push and work harder.
Pushing harder is all that is on Savage’s mind because with the growing global acceptance of her music is also the added responsibility of catering to the earbuds of a larger audience. One would think her sound might change to accommodate her growing diverse fan base but she is more about making music that moves. She says,
“I just make music. I don’t think about making music that will appeal to an international crowd, or a local crowd, I just make the music that moves me.”
Her loyal fans, Savage Soldiers, are ever ready to support the “Queen” no matter what she does hence why she believes her day one fans love her new music even as she adds new ones along the way of her music growth.
Music that moves is what drives Tiwa because her latest album, 49:99, with its title track lead single met with positive reviews and continues to enjoy massive radio play till date. The track’s acceptance spanned across Africa and ‘served as a great launchpad’ of her international music career.
As a way of pushing the Savage brand further, her label and management brokered a number of deals with pretty much all the DSPs to support the campaign. That support included a huge billboard in Times Square courtesy of online streaming platform YouTube.
Although she describes seeing herself on a billboard in Times Square as a ‘surreal experience’, she also understands that her transition into becoming an even bigger star than she already is, needs more than just a billboard feature. Hence her need for a persona restricting with her sound and music business strategy.
The transition she says is important to get her to where she plans to be. She shares,….

Lighthouse Family
Growing up in an era where cigarette adverts were permitted to air on television and radio, it was a tad difficult to miss those deceptive cuts that told us it was a mark of pristine masculinity to puff on neatly wrapped nicotine.
It was also one of those ads – St. Moritz’s – that introduced me to the music of Lighthouse Family. Ocean Drive’s simple yet inspiring lyrics contradict the reality cigarettes represent, but the minds behind it found it beautiful enough – maybe it’s Tunde Baiyewu’s voice – to rest the soul of the commercial on. Such was the power that the band had in the late 1990s and the early 2000s despite the diverse backgrounds of its members.
Baiyewu, although born in Willesden Green, north London, is firmly rooted in the culture of his Nigerian parents. The death of his father at the age of 42 when he was a kid forced his mother to return to Lagos, Nigeria, where he was introduced to Yoruba culture and the music of Fela Kuti, Sunny Ade and Ebenezer Obey. His partner Paul Tucker is a thoroughbred Briton who grew up in a world where such music influence is alien.
Lighthouse Family
Naija Boy
Decades after leaving Nigeria, Tunde insisted he is still a Nigerian without a shade of doubt. Married to a British-Nigerian Tope Adeshina, the Lighthouse Family vocalist said there was no reason to “shy away from my heritage” especially since that heritage enables his creativity.
“A lot of our melodies – I do melodies for most of our songs – come out of the Yoruba language which I speak. There is a certain rhythm to the Yoruba language.”
The bridge in one of Lighthouse Family’s best-known songs, ‘High,’ was influenced by Yoruba. The first line of the bridge, “At the end of the day remember the days,” was written to rhyme with the Yoruba name Ogunmodede, Tunde said. Loosely translated as Ogun (Yoruba’s god of war and metals) brings the hunter home, the name embodies the essence of Yoruba traditional religion and history. And at a point, he had a Nigerian singer – Tiwa Savage – sing backup for the band.
He also pointed to the use of Yoruba on ‘Anaesthetics,’ a song that shows the depth of his emotional vulnerability after his mother’s death, as a way of him connecting to his culture.
What Tunde gained in being acculturated in Nigeria was instrumental to his outlook on music and the creation of melodies for Lighthouse Family songs. It also proved, at some point, to be the cause of healthy conflict with Paul.
“Overall, we are generally on the same page,” Tunde told me. “But there are creative differences that happen sometimes… because of my Nigerian roots.”
But in those “conflicts” Tunde and Paul found the building blocks that form the core of “what we do.”
They found a bond in music so strong that 18 years after their last album – Whatever Gets You Through The Day –, the duo returned in 2019 with an album, Blue Sky in Your Head.
Lighthouse Family
Obasanjo’s son
Years after his father’s death, his mother took another shot at marriage. But his mother getting married to Nigeria’s number one citizen was not what Tunde bargained for. In fact, he was not ready to be someone’s stepson, especially if that person wields great influence.
“I was very standoffish at first, and pretty unforthcoming. I was used to having just a mother–and a mother, I felt, was all I needed,” he said in a 2013 interview.
He was wary of the air of power and influence that came with being a stepson of a military head of state. But his standoffish stance was petered out by his military ruler stepfather’s jocular takes on life.

Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje: The Unwavering Survivor
It was evening when Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje stepped into the lobby of a high-priced hotel in Lagos, Nigeria. His well-built frame and assured poise remind me that I am looking at the same man that held Tyrion & Sir Jorah hostage in the Emmy winning Games of Thrones series. Later in his suite, I would see him whistling Burna Boy’s smash hit, Anybody, as he prepared for his photoshoot.
Akinnuoye-Agbaje is a man who has carefully curated his image. He would later tell me that he is a private person.
“I wasn’t prepared for the invasion of my privacy – that comes with fame. I moved back to England for some time, where I could keep my anonymity and still do my work.”
A man with a powerful story, his story is of one who took the script that life handed to him, rewrote and converted it into a film.
Inspired by his traumatic childhood – a cocktail of rejection, racism and identity crisis – Akinnuoye-Agbaje wrote and directed the biopic film, Farming.
Farming is “a personal story but at the same time, it’s a story that illuminates the phenomenon that happened to thousands of Nigerian children” in Britain in the 1960s, ‘70s to ‘80s.
In 1967, Akinnuoye-Agbaje was born in London to Nigerian parents who had left Nigeria to study in Britain. Six weeks after his birth, his parents left him in the care of a white working-class family in the slum docking town of Tilbury in Essex, in south-east England. He never saw his biological parents again until he was eight years old.
In the foster home, Akinnuoye-Agbaje lived with about 10 other African children, including his two sisters. The house was run by his foster mother. His foster father, a lorry driver, was rarely at home.
Growing up as a black kid in Tilbury, Akinnuoye-Agbaje barely experienced love, inside his foster home or outside of it. A part of this is because his foster parents shouted racial slurs at him.
In an interview with The Guardian UK, he recalls his first memories when he was starting school.
“The sun was shining and the first autumn leaves were beneath my shoes and I was walking with all the other kids to St Mary’s primary. A police car was on the side of the road and the policeman called me over. He half-smiled at me. And then he spat in my face and drove off. I looked around and the sun was still shining, children were walking by and I just remember that hot saliva on my face. I had to carry on going to school.”
Akinnuoye-Agbaje was an easy pick for bullies. He had dogs set on him and bricks thrown at him. His father would force him back out on the streets to stand up on his own. He gave him two choices: fight back or get a beating from him.
When he was eight, his biological parents showed up and took him back to Nigeria. It didn’t end well as he was overwhelmed by a brutal cultural shock and inability to adjust to the new “foreign” environment. Unable to speak the local language, Akinnuoye-Agbaje was so traumatised that he stopped speaking. Concerned by the sudden withdrawal, his [birth] parents sent him back to live in Tilbury.
Back in Tilbury, Akinnuoye-Agbaje was a boy lost in-between two unwelcoming worlds; his native home country in Africa whose culture he couldn’t assimilate and the white populated town of Tilbury whose racist attitude made him a constant target of attacks.
After years of systematic torment from Skinheads with nowhere left to run and being forced to constantly stand his ground, Akinnuoye-Agbaje earned a reputation and eventually joined his oppressors – the Skinheads.
The skinhead subculture originated among working-class youths in London, England in the 1960s. They were recognisable by their clothes – defined by their close-cropped or shaven heads and working-class clothing such as Dr Martens and steel toe work boots, braces, high rise and varying length straight-leg jeans, and button-down collar shirts, usually slim fitting in check or plain.
By the 1970s, things changed as Skinheads became synonymous with extreme nationalist, racist, and anti-immigration attitudes.
Akinnuoye-Agbaje became a black skinhead; always getting in trouble for fighting and shoplifting. When his parents learned of this, they decided to send him to a private boarding school in Surrey.
In Surrey, young Akinnuoye-Agbaje sunk into despair and ultimately attempted to take his own life…

Drama as operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) tried to re-arrest Omoyele Sowore inside the courtroom at the Federal High Court, Abuja… yesterday<br />PHOTO: LUCY LADIDI-ATEKO<br />• Nigeria now a ‘diarchy’
Drama as operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) tried to re-arrest Omoyele Sowore inside the courtroom at the Federal High Court, Abuja… yesterday<br />PHOTO: LUCY LADIDI-ATEKO<br />
Without knowing it, the Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria’s detachment of secret police, is helping Omoyele Sowore to push his agenda for #RevolutionNow. In its attempts to smother the call for citizens’ demand for good governance and accountability, the DSS has, by its unthinking procedure to emasculate the convener of #RevolutionNow and publisher of online news platform, SaharaReporters, exposed the defects in the country’s presidency.
Furthermore, the hint at the country’s gradual slide into diarchy is not lost on many in the outrage that has attended the recent courthouse commotion that trailed the DSS’s Gestapo approach to re-arrest Sowore.
In the voices for and against, two camps have been established between those that favour fascism and enthusiastic supporters of real democracy. In all, Sowore’s counsel and democracy activist, Mr. Femi Falana, has cleverly exposed the underbelly of those championing the return to authoritarian system of government in the country. Explaining what happened in court that fateful Friday, Falana stated: “When I informed the court that fresh charges were being filed against our clients and that they could be re-arrested, the prosecution denied any such plan.
“As soon as the case was adjourned, the DSS pounced on Sowore and caused a disruption of the proceedings of the court. Having taken over the courtroom, Justice Ojukwu hurriedly rose and asked the Registrar to adjourn all other cases.”
But, despite the facts of what happened before many people, the prosecutor tried to deny the obvious to the extent of saying that the invasion never happened. And in a bid to exonerate itself from the violation of the hallowed arena of justice, the president pushed back on an attempt to put the DSS’s blame on it, saying that the DSS does not take instructions from the president.
In the statement by Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari on Media and Public Affairs, Mr. Garba Shehu, the presidency described Sowore not only as a person of interest but also that it “should not surprise anyone that the DSS is after” him.
Part of the statement read: “The presidency notes some of the insinuations in the media about the arrest by the Department of State Services (DSS) of the agitator, Omoyele Sowore. However, it should not surprise anyone who has followed his actions and words that Sowore is a person of interest to the DSS. Sowore called for a revolution to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nigeria. He did so on television, and from a privileged position as the owner of a widely-read digital newspaper run from the United States of America.”
Earlier, the president’s Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, claimed that the attempt at forceful removal of Sowore from the courtroom was a drama acted by his supporters to make the Buhari administration look bad, adding that there was no such thing.
The clumsy denial, with another variant that Sowore’s supporters subjected him to the dehumanizing physical attacks, was dismissed by Falana, saying: “If Sowore’s supporters subjected him to such brutalisation in the presence of DSS operatives, why were they not arrested for contravening the provisions of the Anti-Torture Act, 2017? Or were the DSS operatives expecting the supporters of a defendant wanted by the state to kill him in their presence?”
While revealing that the DSS came to the court with no warrant of arrest and detention order, the senior lawyer noted that although “this country was ruled by military dictators for about three decades, at no time did security operatives invade court premises to arrest political activists inside a courtroom.”
Throw back to NASS invasion
THE December 6 attempt to whisk Sowore away from the premises of a Federal High Court in Abuja came as a cheap rehash of a similar attack on the National Assembly complex on August 7, 2018, that is precisely 16 months ago.
On that fateful day, hooded DSS operatives barricaded the gate to the National Assembly complex. As the hooded operatives stood sentry at the NASS gate, the two presiding officers of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki and Ike Ekweremadu, were also hemmed in at their respective residences.
Given that Saraki had by then defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), there were indications that the presence of the hooded security operatives was to provide cover for APC lawmakers, who claimed to be in the majority, to change the Senate leadership.
The DSS’s action was greeted with massive national outcry and condemnation, just like in the current Sowore debacle. National chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus, condemned the security siege on the Abuja residences of Senate President Bukola Saraki and his deputy, Ike Ekweremadu, stressing that the DSS’s action was aimed at the forcible overthrow of the National Assembly leadership “and rendering it comatose.”
While describing the siege as an “attack on democracy,” the PDP national chairman declared: “It is now a known fact that democracy has collapsed in Nigeria and we are now under a totalitarian and fascist government with no appetite for the opposition.”
Piqued by the unwarranted siege on the nation’s symbol of democracy, the then Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, summoned the then Director-General of DSS, Lawal Daura, to the Presidential Villa, where he was debriefed. The Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, who was also summoned to the Villa for the same purpose, ensured that Daura’s retinue of security orderlies and patrol vehicles were withdrawn from him.
Nigerians heaved a huge sigh of relief at the prompt sacking of Daura, which was made possible by the fact that President Buhari was at the time on medical vacation in London. Speaking at a world press conference on the attack on the National Assembly, then President of Senate, Saraki said: “It is a matter of record that yesterday, lawmakers and staff of the National Assembly were prevented from entering the National Assembly Complex by heavily armed security agents of the Department of State Services (DSS). All entries to the Complex were blocked. The National Assembly, the seat of democracy in Nigeria, was under lockdown. Senators and members of the House of Representatives were prevented from gaining access.
“…Some of you may recall that about two years ago, I stated that there was a government within this government, to a purpose that was not in the interest of what the people voted for. I said it then, and now we are beginning to see the manifestations of that government within a government. It beats one’s imagination how the head of an agency could have authorized the brazen assault on the legislature that we saw yesterday.”
Divided presidency
Unlike in the National Assembly instance of last year, it is obvious that apart from conflicting voices from the presidency, there would be no consequences for the violation of the hallowed precincts of another arm of government.
It also seeks the establishment of a governing board for the commission, which shall include one person each from the other five geopolitical zones of the country.
South-East NYSC coordinator inaugurates entrepreneurship centre in Aba.
Alhaji Ahmed Ikaka, the South East Zonal Coordinator, National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), on Tuesday inaugurated a new Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Department (SAED) Centre built by corps members serving in Osisioma, near Aba.
Speaking at the event, Ikaka lauded the efforts of the corps members, saying that NYSC was leading the economic revolution in Nigeria with the skill acquisition training given to corps members.
He assured Nigerians of better economy with the series of training given to corps members to make them self-reliant.
He said that Nigeria had no reason to be patronising foreign goods when its youths creatively produce such goods.
READ ALSO: The NYSC uniform controversy.
The NYSC boss, therefore, urged Nigerians to patronise local manufacturers and assist them to strengthen their economy.
“We should produce what we consume.
We have the best skills in the world.
You have seen from the exhibition we had here the production of shoes, hats, clothings and other things.
“We have seen also those in agro-allied, food production and processing.
“We cannot be deceiving ourselves, no nation develops on importation.
The life of a nation depends on the skills of its citizens and none develops beyond the citizens’ skills.
“So NYSC is changing Nigeria’s narrative by developing the skills of these corps members and they are becoming job creators, instead of job seekers.
“A lot of NYSC members are contributing to the economic development of our nation.
“This is the only way we can move forward, we cannot continue to deceive ourselves,” Ikaka said.
He said that corps members had learnt to write business proposals, given loan windows with Bank of Industry offering N2 billon, Central Bank providing N400 million, Heritage Bank fund, NYSC Foundation fund and Credit Direct fund.
He said with about N10 million available for corps members to access, it will be easy for them to succeed outside the service and improve Nigeria’s economy.
The state NYSC Coordinator, Lady Bona Fasakin, said that Osisioma Local Government Area (LGA) had been partners in progress with NYSC.
Fasakin said that the council provided the land, where the centre was built, adding that by that act the council had keyed into the vision of the scheme in its fight against unemployment.
She urged other councils and stakeholders in Abia to emulate Osisioma’s example by providing skills training equipment to sustain the vision and ensure that corps members become job providers.
She further called for support for NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers so that rural dwellers would benefit from the programme.
The Transition Chairman of Osisioma LGA, Mr Ugochukwu Nwaogu, said the council would continue to assist in making life better for the corps members serving in the area.
Nwaogu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Joseph Iguodo, said the council would seek ways to provide a lodge for corps members in the area.
The council boss pledged N50,000 donation to support NYSC programmes in the area.
The Local Government Zonal Inspector, Mrs Ruth Jacob, thanked the council for its support, while commending the corps members for their commitment in actualising the project.
Jacob said that the centre had taught the corps members how to produce many items that could enhance their economy and contribute to the nation’s socio-economic development.
(Updated) Supreme court removes prominent Oyo monarch, Eleruwa of Eruwa.
Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola.
By Adeola Badru.
Twenty-one years after he ascended the throne of his forebears, the Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola has been dethroned by the Supreme Court on Friday morning.
Vanguard recalls that an Oyo State High Court had on January 26, 2011 removed.
But not satisfied, he appealed the judgement.
The sacked monarch was installed the Eleruwa in 1998 by the Oyo State Government amidst protracted protests by members of the rightful ruling house after the last Eleruwa, the late Oba Bolanle Olaniyan, who is from the Akalako ruling house, passed on , on May 1, 1994.
Although his nomination and selection by the kingmakers were challenged by the Laribikusi house, which argued that he was not a member of the ruling arm, but belonged to Akalako where the previous king emerged, the state government went ahead to inaugurate him, prompting the present action.

Those who challenged the authenticity of Adegbola’s claims to the throne are Mr.
James Olatunde Idowu and Alhaji Ajao.
Joined in the suit besides Adegbola are: the Governor of Oyo State, the Attorney General, Ibarapa Local Government, Chief Jacob Adewusi, Chief Femi Atanda, Chief Idowu Okeowo, Chief E.
Ojebisi and Mr.
Kasali I.
The plaintiffs, represented by the lawyer, Alhaji Lasun Sanusi (SAN) sought eight reliefs in their statement of claims which were all granted by the court.
Having summarized all the submissions of the counsel to both sides, Justice Abimbola resolved all the issues in favour of the plaintiffs.
When Nigeria’s slow wheel of justice caught up with Uzor Kalu.
After a 12-year trial period, Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, was yesterday brought to book for offences committed against his people.
In the wake of Nigeria’s return to democratic governance in 1999, Kalu was one of the governors elected to steer the affairs of the states of the federation and help fulfill the yearnings of the masses for purposeful governance and true development.
But amid actions that simulated development and got praise singers christening him ‘the messiah,’ he plundered the state’s till, grossly under-developed his people and set the tone for their sustained impoverishment.
Shortly after stepping down as governor in 2007, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) took him to court on a 39-count charge bordering on diversion of about N7.
65 billion from the state’s purse.
And yesterday, after a drawn trial, he was handed a 12-year jail sentence at a Federal High Court in Lagos by presiding judge, Mohammed Idris, for money laundering.
In addition to the sentence, Justice Idris ordered that Kalu’s company, Slok Nigeria Limited, be liquidated and its assets forfeited to the Federal Government.
The senator, Slok Nigeria Limited and Udeh Udeogu, a former director of finance and accounts in Abia, were found complicit in the diversion.

Betty Akeredolu: We’ll not relent until women are treated fairly.
The wife of Ondo State governor, Arabinrin Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, has vowed not to relent until women are given equal rights as their male counterparts.
Mrs Anyanwu-Akeredolu spoke on Wednesday during the 2nd summit of Forum for Women Officials of Ondo State and Female Appointees (FOWOSO) held at International Culture and Event Centre in Akure, the state capital.
“We will not faint until we see women everywhere being treated with as much respect as their male counterparts.
“The pursuit of gender quality is definitely daunting, many rocks of stereotypes are particularly exerting, but when men join us, we are further strengthened to prevail quickly.
But, whatever the case , we shall prevail,” she said.
She called for gender inclusiveness in all aspects of the socio-economic, saying that ‘ spectrum is still miles ahead.
We know this and we are not going to relent.
’.
Anyanwu-Akeredolu, who is the founder of FOWOSO, noted that her motivation was not because she is a woman.
She called for a society where continuous development was achieved and sustained.
“We must come to the understanding that everyone, regardless of gender is needed for sustainable development.
“I have dedicated my life to driving gender equality, not because I love female folk more ,but because I seek the growth and advancement of humanity as a whole.
“I am very delighted to know that I have infected every FOWOSO member with this positive virus that strives for gender equality in every aspect of our socio-economic spectrum,” she explained.
Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu described as unquantifiable the training and empowerment of women in the state by FOWOSO.
He said the activities of the forum, particularly in the areas of training and empowerment of women across the 18 local government areas, had produced many entrepreneurs.
Speaking on the theme of the summit; “Prioritising Women’s Health and Well Being In Nigeria”, Akeredolu said his administration had prioritised the well-being of women in the state.
He added: “We have prioritised women health and well-being in Ondo State and that was what led to the Abiyamo Maternal and Child Health Scheme which we launched on Wednesday.
All you need to access the free health care for pregnant women is your residency cards.
Every child under 5 is entitled to free health care in Ondo State.
”.
“Let me commend the efforts of the founder for this laudable initiative geared towards the development of womenfolk in Ondo State,” Akeredolu stated.
The Chairman of 2nd FOWOSO Planning Committee, Mrs Mercy Femi-Idris, described the forum as significant to health and welfare of women, adding that it was about nurturing and empowering female folks.
Prof.
Modupe Adelabu, the Chairman of the occasion, noted that FOWOSO had given women voice of recognition.
Adelabu, the former director governor of Ekiti State, said the forum had eliminated discrimination against women, noting that FOWOSO was a fun-making gathering but a life-impacful organisation.
Mrs Bisi Fayemi, the wife of Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi and Mrs Kafayat Oyetola, the wife of Osun State governor attended the summit.
How to boost cyber security – experts.
Stakeholders the Nigerian cyber security space under the aegis of the Information Security Society of Africa-Nigeria (ISSAN) have called for collaborations in boosting cyber security in the country.
They made the call while speaking at a Cyber Security Workshop Themed: “DDoS Evolution – Staying Protected” organised by ISSAN in collaboration with 21st Century Technologies Limited in Lagos.
While welcoming stakeholders at the Workshop, President of ISSAN, Dr.
David Isiavwe, decried the worsening state of cyber security in the country.
He said, “Those who watch the cyber space closely, will all agree that there is a lot of happenings each and every day.
New forms of attacks are being contrived and implemented by the bad guys, and all they need is one successful attempt.
We hear of all the various attacks both on individuals and companies alike.
Indeed, even the cyber security gatekeepers are not spared.
And huge sums of money are at risk each time there is a successful attack.
”.
Dr.
Isiavwe who is also the Group Head Operations & Technology, Ecobank Nigeria Limited, further lamented the fact that everyone and every institution was susceptible to these attacks as social engineering attack is unrelenting.
He said data based manipulation-insiders and outsiders is on the rise, attack on card data and card processing technology infrastructure via rogue IT infrastructure, spear phishing attack and combination of different methodologies were rampant.
He therefore called on all stakeholders to be proactive, create customer awareness activities, continuous and automated monitoring of systems and infrastructure, employment of Artifucial intelligence and Machine Learning as well as robotics and data analytics.
He also called for collaborations among stakeholders.
Speaking on the theme of the workshop in a keynote address, Long Lee Shih – DDoS Security Expert, Nexusguard Ltd, also explained how individuals and organisations could avoid being victims of cyber attacks, including Origin Protection (OP) for large networks, among others.
His keynote address was followed by a robust plenary session that included Dr Wale Obadare, MD/COO, Digital Encode Ltd; Long Lee Shih, Ighoakpo Eduje, Chief Information Security Officer, Heritage Bank Ltd; Igboa Abumere, Chief Information Security Officer, Stanbic IBTC Bank; Bharat Soni, Chief Information Security Officer, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Dr.

Hit-and-run driver kills woman in Awka.
A yet to be identified woman was on Sunday killed by a hit-and-run driver in Awka.
The accident occurred at about 11:05pm at Regina Caeli Junction on the Enugu-Onitsha expressway.
According to Mr Andrew Kumapayi, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Anambra, the accident left the woman dead instantly.
Kumapayi said the corpse had been deposited at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital morgue, Awka.
The sector commander reiterated the call for pedestrians to be careful on the road, especially during festive periods, because of increased vehicular movement.
“My advice to road users especially pedestrians during this season is to be extra careful when crossing the road.
“They should endeavour to use the pedestrian bridge provided for them if any, and if there is none, they should look left, right and left again to make sure that the road is free before crossing.
“Let them wear reflective clothes when walking in the night so that they can be seen by oncoming vehicles,” he said.
What Onitsha fire tells us about the petrol tankers from hell [Pulse Opinion].
The Onitsha fire accident was totally avoidable.
Yet again, Nigeria has killed citizens whose only crime was hustling in a country that never got their backs.
Onitsha, the Anambra state capital, is mourning.
And all of Nigeria with it.
On Wednesday, October 16, 2019, a petrol laden tanker rammed into buildings in an Onitsha market, spilled its contents in the neigborhood and sparked a fire that ravaged buildings, consumed goods worth millions of Naira and ended lives.
Onitsha was a ball of fire for hours and no one lifted a finger.
The city is still counting its losses.
The casualty figures from the incident are still hazy at the time of writing, but it has been confirmed that a mother and her child were among the dead; with the fire searing through their skins and leaving them locked in each other''s arms until the very end.'
The fire incident in Onitsha yesterday is sad and regrettable.
I am profoundly touched by the sight of the charred remains of an innocent mother and her child, who are victims of this tragedy,” said President Muhammadu Buhari.
Former Nigeria Vice President and presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar said: “We''ve had many preventable fuel tanker tragedies.'
I received with sadness, reports of a tanker explosion in Onitsha, Anambra State, which caused massive destruction to lives and properties in Ochanja Market area.
My prayers and thoughts are with the families of the affected.
”.
TV personality Ebuka Obi-Uchendu said: “Last night was a lot.
We really are on our own in this country.
Those images from Onitsha are still so heartbreaking.
May the departed Rest In Peace.
”.
One of the biggest takeaways from the tragedy is that the fire raged for hours with no fire service truck anywhere near the scene of the inferno.
And like Atiku mentioned, this is one of several petrol tanker accidents in recent times across Nigeria that has led to loss of lives.
Apart from the Otedola bridge fire incident of June 2018 in Lagos that led to loss of lives and the burning of cars, there have been several instances where a petrol laden tanker, flouting all known traffic laws in the land, goes ahead to inflict pain and misery on innocent families and ordinary Nigerians.
In Lagos where this writer resides, petrol tanker and articulated truck drivers derive immense joy from intimidating other road users, offloading their containers on busy roads and obstructing free flow of traffic.
Articulated trucks and petrol tankers have been a menace in Nigeria for as long as anyone can remember and the regulatory agencies or authorities have largely looked the other way unperturbed for decades.
Until the next disaster.
“I call on the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other stakeholders to urgently address the issue of safety standards in Nigeria, with a view to stemming the frequency of these tragedies.
May the souls of the dead rest in peace Amen,” President Buhari said, without stating how he will make sure the agencies he mentioned sanitize our roads and put the killer truck drivers in check.
Without saying how he''ll lead the charge in enforcing compliance.'
It is also a shame that a state as rich as Anambra has no functioning fire service department or emergency response units; and that when tragedy struck, Governor Willie Obiano was not on the ground to provide succour.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the Onitsha inferno was completely avoidable.
Yet again, we have lost lives to poor governance across all tiers.
Writer Ayo Sogunro was right after all when he said “everything in Nigeria is going to kill you.

Stolen children rescued, reunited with their parents by police in Anambra 13 days ago 4137 views by Nurudeen Lawal.     - Anambra state police command said it has rescued two stolen children in the state.     - The command’s spokesperson said the children have since been reunited with their parents.     - Two women arrested for stealing the children will be charged to court after investigations are concluded, the police said Two children who were reportedly stolen in Anambra state have been rescued by the police in the state and reunited with their parents.     The police said on Monday, November 25, that the children were stolen from Enugwu Aguleri in the Anambra East local government area, according to Sahara Reporters.     The police, while handing over the kids to their parents, cautioned parents to always be conscious of the movements of their children.     The children were allegedly stolen by two women, namely Ani Chisom and Afamefuna Udodili, the police spokesperson in the state, Haruna Mohammed, said.     The police explained that the parents of the stolen children came to identify their kids after the development was publicly announced.     Mohammed said the suspects will be charged to court upon the conclusion of investigations.     n a related development, the kidnap of two children in Gombe and their eventual rescue in Anambra state has continued to generate reactions among Nigerians.     John Abang, the commissioner of police in Anambra, said that the two children have been reunited with their parents.     The children were kidnapped while playing along with other children in their parents’ compound.     A surge in child kidnap While both the young and old have been victims of kidnapping in the country, there seems to be a surge in the rate of children being kidnapped or stolen recently.     A few weeks ago, Muhammad Sanusi 11, the emir of Kano, advised parents to take responsibility for the children they bring into the world, adding that the importance of child upbringing cannot be overemphasised.     Anambra State places ban on movement of trucks.     The Anambra State Government has aced a ban on the movement of trucks during the day in the state.     This is in reaction to the incessant collapse of trucks and tankers leading to great losses in the state.     The state Commissioner for Information, Don Adinuba ated that trucks are oy allowed to move in the state from 8p.     m to 5a.     m.     A statement issued reads “Following the incessant collapse of trucks carrying petroleum products in Anambra State in recent times, including one which happened in Onitsha earlier today(Thursday), the Anambra State Government has decided to restrict the time which vehicles laden with petroleum products can move in the state.     “With effect from Saturday, November 2, 2019, such vehicles can be allowed to move within Anambra State from only 8 p.     m.     to 5 a.     m.     “The restriction is to enable agencies like the Anambra State Fire Service, the Nigeria Police Force, the Federal Road Safety Corps, the Civil Defence, the Anambra Traffic Management Agency and indeed all other security, law enforcement and safety agencies to respond effectively and in good time to emergencies created by such accidents.     ”.     Anambra raises alarm over fake news of insecurity.     Worried over fake reports on social media about security situation in Anambra State allegedly sponsored by some disgruntled elements in the state, the government has come out to dispel the rumours and allay fear of any insecurity.     In an official statement released on Tuesday and signed by the state’s Commissioner for Information & Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, the government said “We would like to alert Anambra people and other Nigerians about the resolve of a handful of so-called opposition politicians to use the social media, which mostly do not have gatekeepers and fact checkers, to create fear in the people about the security situation in the state.     “Though the 2021 gubernatorial election is about two years away, these politicians have long started to campaign with absolute falsehoods and simulated reports.     ”.     The release accused peddlers of the said news of aiming to rubbish the enviable security record of Anambra which it said has in the last four years, been consistently adjudged the safest state in Nigeria and widely considered the safest place in West and Central Africa.     The statement reminded that Anambra was the only state in Nigeria which did not record a single bank robbery in the past five years.     According to the state government, “the latest antics of the opposition are claims that Reverend Father Edward Obiora, a practising lawyer in Awka, was kidnapped at the weekend and that 15 school children were kidnapped at Central School, Awkuzu, in Oyi Local Government Area yesterday.     “These are blatantly false claims.     Father Edward was at the court yesterday, Monday, October 28, in Awka to handle a case, and he was free, healthy and hearty.     Mrs Josephine Okwenna, the Head Teacher at Awkuzu Central School has described the social media account that 15 pupils in his school were kidnapped as totally false and embarrassing and a great disservice to both the school and the Awkuzu community.     “Anambra people are enjoined to watch out for more salacious reports about the security situation in their state.     The opposition propagandists have even planned to stage manage kidnappings for ransom in the state, so that investors and other well meaning people will treat our dear homeland as a pariah.     “Let our people at home and elsewhere continue to treat such simulated shows and reports and those who sponsor them with the contempt they deserve.     Kidnapping seems to be the second nature of these politicians who want to take our state to the primitive age of mankind.     After all, they introduced kidnapping in the Nigerian political space when they abducted in 2003 Governor Chris Ngige, a fellow party member, and forged a letter claiming that he had resigned from office.     “It amounts to dethronement of reason for a small clique of politicians whom the great Professor Chinua Achebe memorably called renegades to de-market the very state they want to hijack by all means and rule like a failed fiefdom.     They are determined to drag Anambra, which is today’s Nigeria’s fastest developing state, down back to the level of a failed state when they were in power and could not pay salaries, compelling schools to shut down for one year.     They want Anambra State to become a lawless and bankrupt fiefdom where they can easily burn down in broad daylight institutions and symbols of the state like the Government House, House of Assembly and the Judicial Complex, as they did for a whole three days in November, 2003.     “Ndi Anambra and, indeed, all Nigerians are assured once again that never again will Anambra be associated with state capture or state failure.
