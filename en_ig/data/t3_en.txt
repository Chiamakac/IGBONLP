Do you know breast milk is not only cheap and hygienic but has all the nutrient a baby needs for better psychological development
In this special report, Ekwi Ajide takes a look at the reasons why doctors advocate exclusive breast feeding for the first six months.
VOICE
Exclusive breast feeding entails feeding the baby with breast milk for at least six months or nine months at most without water, medicine or any other type of food.
Exclusive breast feeding according to a medical practitioner, Dr Cliff Okafor is the only sure way of preventing contamination and as well bond with the baby.

Participants at a two day capacity training workshop in Abakaliki, Ebonyi state have identified the deconstruction of patriarchal dominant view in society as a major step towards actualization of thirty- five per cent Affirmative Action.
Speakers at the ongoing workshop with its theme as "The role of Civil Society Organisations and Media in Achieving full Implementation of thirty- five per cent Affirmative Action in South East", were of the view that male chauvinism has been limiting the participation of women in critical decision making process of the society.
One of the resource persons, Prince Sam Ezeanyika who listed obstacles to achieving the Affirmative Action to include poverty, insecurity, cultural inhibitions, and political party structures, emphasized that education, financial empowerment and media exposure can assist more Women to have access to leadership.
He regretted that most of the needed dynamism and positive changes lacking so far in the nation's political leadership are absent because women who can bring about them are too few in the highest decision making level.

If the children innocently consume all that comes their way, the elderly who should have had better experience about life should note that the future they hope to bequeath the progeny is on the line.

He said it is in recognition of the importance of the annual rainfall predictions that NIMET is being empowered and positioned for more accuracy.
“We are acquiring capability through NIMET to cascade and drop it down within meters and inches of accuracy.
In 2017, some farmers in Sokoto came to testify that from the prediction and the advice they had gotten that they were able to make good harvest for the season, and unfortunately others who didn’t follow the advice had losses.
Mr Moghalu urged participants at the seminar to make suggestions on how to key into global shipping community to maximise Anambra’s comparative advantage in the sector for growth of the economy.
The Committee’s terms of reference also include: examining the consumption vis-a-vis production of agricultural products within a particular period, and relating issues of SRP with food security.
He urged the committee members to take the job very seriously as a national assignment, and do it with all the necessary due diligence as well as finish on time, considering its likely effects on Nigeria’s food sufficiency capacity.
Chairman of the Committee and Director Planning Research and Statistics, Mohammed Shehu, pledged that members will work assiduously and deliver as expected.

He invited existing customers, who are on the Smile network, as well as new customers to take advantage of the TRUEUnlimited internet offer and to have a very blissful Yuletide.
The new campaigns; “Perfect Gift” and “TRUE UnlimitedPremium” are available in key Nigerian towns including Abuja, Asaba, Benin, Ibadan, Kaduna, Lagos, Onitsha, and Port-Harcourt.
These offers are available be accessed via www.smile.com.ng, and at all Smile shops, kiosks and authorised distributors spread across the country.
The chairman said that the road show was organised to hold simultaneously in the three Senatorial zones in the state, so that every community in the state would be reached.
State Monitor, Anambra Government Business Tax Office (AGBTO), Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), Awka, Mr Ikpo Okereke, said that the campaign was a tripartite collaboration between the chartered Institute of taxation of Nigeria (CITN), FIRS and AIRS.
``So, we are trying to sensitise Anambra people on the need to pay their taxes.’’
The Nigeria Institute of Soil Science (NISS) has said it is ready to clampdown on unqualified and fake soil scientists in the country.
The institute said it had reached an advanced stage towards the planned prosecution of unqualified soil scientists.
The Registrar, NISS, Professor Victor Chude, who made this known in Abuja at the induction ceremony of newly registered soil scientists, said the move became necessary following high level of quackery among soil scientists in the country.
Chude said the induction of the newly registered soil scientists was to establish the culture of standards.
He said the NISS Act 2017 is to regulate the profession of soil science, the use and management of soil resources to maintain high soil quality for sustainable crop production.
According to him, soil scientists play the same role as doctors do, and if the soil is not properly treated, it will not support the production of crops and it will not allow it produce good yield.
“With the induction of the soil scientists, there is going to be awareness created for people to know how we operate.
We are going to have an amendment to the Act as soil is a vital and non-renewable component of the ecosystem,” he said.
However, President of NISS and chairman of the Council, Professor Ayo Ogunkunle, said the negative impact of charlatans among soil scientists could affect millions of people for several years before detection.
Prof Ogunkunle, who noted that the importance of the regulation of the standards qualification and skills of soil scientists could not be over-emphasised, said the soil resources of the nation must not be neglected or allowed to degrade.
While noting that the detailed survey and mapping of Nigeria’s soil resources are overdue, he the solicited support from the government in view of its importance.
He said: “Agricultural soil is the real wealth of a nation as it is basic to human existence, essential for food, feeds, fibres and fuel production.
“A crucial requirement for appropriate use and management of the soil resources of a nation is a good knowledge of the various soil components and characteristics.
This is not possible without a detailed soil survey of the country,” he said.
Mr Okereke said that his office was in charge of collecting value added and withholding taxes from all government agencies in Anambra State.
Photo; PIXABAYThe Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) has said that it has commenced talks with filling plant owners and other relevant stakeholders in order to commence the re-qualification of used gas cylinders.
A statement signed by the Deputy Director and Head, Taxpayer Education and Enlightenment Team (TEET), Mrs Sylvia Tochukwu-Ngige, said that the campaign would hold from March 2 to March 7.
The theme for the Tax Week which is: `Voluntary Compliance to Tax Payment’, is geared toward sensitising Ndi Anambra on the whole processes of taxation.
However, the agency stated that the exercise would appear daunting in view of individual ownership of liquefied petroleum gas (cooking gas) cylinder in the country.
Director, Inspectorate and Compliance Directorate, SON, Obiora Manafa, stated that plans are underway to work with stakeholders in the industry to begin a requalification scheme which would put every used cylinder through a requalification exercise to ensure that a cylinder is not used beyond its expiration date.
Identifying some of the challenges likely to be faced by the programme, especially in relation to the replacement of cylinders after withdrawal, he stated that in a country where gas cylinders are owned by individuals, it would be difficult to carry out the scheme as its being done in other countries where cylinders are owned by marketers.
“In Nigeria, cylinders are owned by individuals but owned by marketers in other climes and once the cylinders are due for recertification, it is easy for withdrawal, but difficult to get these cylinders from individuals to do requalification.
“The only way it can work is if any consumer takes a cylinder to a filling plant to refill and the plant owner checks the cylinder and it is due for requalification, the plant owners should be given powers to seize the cylinder.
These are some of the things we are working with other stakeholders in the industry to address,” he said.
Manafa added that the life span of a cylinder is 15 years and when using a brand new cylinder, users have to calculate another 15 years for the usage.
“However, unscrupulous importers go outside the country to bring in these cylinders that have been discarded and have been used for over 30 years.
These cylinders are not allowed in the Nigerian market because they are dead on arrival and they are not safe for anybody to use, they are expired and weak”, he said.
He advised importers and consumers to always seek advice from SON before purchasing these cylinders while recommending the usage of brand new cylinders certified by SON.
He further urged importers to stick to the specification of the standards, warning that going out of the standards would only see their products seized and destroyed.
An importer, Mary Amos, opined that SON has been embarking on enforcement exercises to rid the country of sub-standard goods.
She noted that many stakeholders in different sectors of the economy including the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) have called on the present administration to empower more than ever before, the regulatory agency to perform its responsibilities.
The Group Head, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, SON Nwaoma Olujie urged consumers to look out for markings such as date of manufacturing, country of origin and manufacturer’s name for traceability, adding that all the information are embossed on the cylinder.
She also urged Nigerians to purchase only cylinders with SON registration marks in order to safeguard their homes from fire incidents caused by substandard cylinders.
Mr Okereke said that his office was in charge of collecting value added and withholding taxes from all government agencies in Anambra State.
Photo: PIXABAYResearchers and industry experts have restated the need to deepen the current effort in exploring Nigeria’s frontier inland basins to improve the nation’s economy and oil and gas projections.
Nigeria is aiming to increase its crude oil reserve base to over 40 billion barrels and daily production to about 3 million barrels.
The experts, who gathered at the second summit on research activities in Nigeria’s frontier basins, insisted that there was a need for collaboration and sustainability.
Currently, over 93 per cent of Nigeria’s oil production comes from the Niger Delta basin but the Federal Government had stated that there was a need to explore other sedimentary basins, including Bida, Gongola, Sokoto, Benue Trough, Anambra and Dahomey in an attempt to diversify the country’s hydrocarbon resources.
Already, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has announced the discovery of oil in Gongola basin and currently working on the commercial viability of the resources.
With over 11 research papers and other presentation by industry players focusing on “Nigeria’s Frontier Basins: Vehicle for Reserve Growth through R&D”, the stakeholders noted that exploring the frontier basins remain timely, considering that the relevance crude oil dwindles as the international communities shift from oil.
Speaking at the event, which was sponsored by the National Centre for Petroleum Research and Development (NCPRD), Energy Commission of Nigeria in collaboration with the NNPC, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency and the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kyari, said there was need to intensify collaboration to achieve desired outcomes in the ongoing exploration activities in the frontier basins.
Kyari said NNPC would continue to lead the campaign to ensure that more works are carried out in the basins, with a view to increasing the nation’s reserves, investment opportunities and create employment for the teeming youths in the Country.
He, however, noted that this feat could only be achieved through doggedness, consistency, creative thinking as well as innovative ideas and the deployment of new emerging technologies.
A statement signed by the Deputy Director and Head, Taxpayer Education and Enlightenment Team (TEET), Mrs Sylvia Tochukwu-Ngige, said that the campaign would hold from March 2 to March 7.
The theme for the Tax Week which is: `Voluntary Compliance to Tax Payment’, is geared toward sensitising Ndi Anambra on the whole processes of taxation.
Kyari said NNPC was ready to actively collaborate with competent institutions of learning to carry out exploration activities, especially in the areas of geological and geophysical data generation, environmental baseline studies, drilling location preparation, among others, saying this would bridge the gap between the academia and the Industry.
Also speaking at the event, the Director-General/CEO, Energy Commission of Nigeria, Prof. Eli Jidere Bala, expressed total confidence in the collaborative capacity of NNPC to galvanize the commitment and leadership needed to achieve the expansion drive through research and development, as part of the goals of and target of the summit.
``Activities for the week include visit of the president of CITN, Dame Gladys Simplice, who will use the opportunity to inaugurate a District Society of the Institute at Onitsha,’’ it said.
The Vice-Chancellor of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Prof. Abdulazeez Muhammad Ahmad, who said the university was part of the late 1990s exploration campaign in the Kolmani River-II of the Gongola Sub-basin of North-East Nigeria said though SNEPCo earlier reported a non-commercial gas discovery in Kolmani, the school independently studied another well Nasara-1 as a PhD research and indicated the presence of oil in the well-sourced from lacustrine sediments.
All staff of AIRS and some staff members of FIRS participated in the road show.
According to him, the finding earned NUC’s best PhD award from all physical sciences from all Nigerian universities for the year 2006 as well as NMGS/Chevron best PhD award for the same year.
Over 100 representatives of key stakeholder groups in the agricultural sector met in Abuja on November 19, 2019, to validate results from several stakeholder consultative meetings organised to identify constraints hampering agricultural mechanisation in Nigeria and proffer recommendations for improvement with the aim of supporting the development of a national policy on agricultural mechanisation.
The one-day workshop captioned ‘Agricultural Mechanisation Policy Validation Workshop’ was organised by Propcom Mai-karfi, a UK government-funded rural market development programme implemented in Northern Nigeria.
The increasing demand for mechanisation among an estimated 77 million farmer population as well as factors limiting better use of Nigeria’s agricultural mechanisation potential underscore the importance of reviewing the agricultural mechanisation policy within the present drive to make Nigeria more self-sufficient in its food requirements.
Some of these limiting factors reported by stakeholders are poor access to credit, high cost of agricultural equipment, minimal private sector engagement, weak advocacy and lack of a clear framework guiding implementation of the broad statements on agricultural mechanisation in the National Agriculture Promotion Policy.
Developing an implementation plan for agricultural mechanisation in the National Agriculture Promotion Policy, introducing policy on compulsory in-country assembly of tractors and other agricultural machinery, developing federal policy on land development and offering financial incentives to states to develop farmlands, expanding the mechanisation policy to comprise irrigation infrastructure, land clearing and post-harvest storage activities, and extending the zero-tariffs policy to tipping trailers and agricultural machinery spare parts are some recommendations proffered by stakeholders to address these limitations.
“We hope to influence policy and help Nigeria define a path for improving mechanisation and expanding the required access to finance in Nigeria,” said Ogheneovo Ugbebor, Deputy Team Leader at Propcom Mai-karfi.
“The engagements and coming together of different agricultural stakeholders in Nigeria have actually gone up and we are seeing the benefits.
Mechanisation is a specialist area and it is something we must do well if we are to propel agriculture in Nigeria” – Dr Chijioke Osuji, Federal University of Technology, Owerri.
“Through this process it is evident that there are organisations that have interest in improving agricultural mechanisation in Nigeria.
With this great work that Propcom Mai-karfi is doing I am sure that in the next 5 years agricultural mechanisation will go a long way many more people, especially in rural areas, will benefit.
” said Felicia Nzomisaki, Permanent Secretary at the State Ministry of Agriculture, Adamawa State.
“This is one of the few times in planning and policy processes for agricultural development where we have strict adherence to different components and stages of policy formulation before we arrive at a concise policy document, which in this case is the National Policy on Agricultural Mechanisation. ” – Professor Ayoola Gboladade, Farm and Infrastructure Foundation (FIF).
HEALTH MINISTRY SAYS NO TRACE OF CORONA VIRUS IN ANAMBRA, ADVOCATES FOR PROPER HYGIENE
Others present at the event were the Kano State Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr. Hadi Bala Yahaya; Head of the Agriculture and Food Security Policy Commission of the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG), Ms. Gloria Ekpo; Directors at the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM), Drs. Segun Ademiluyi and Isaac Ozumba; and the Chairman of Tractor Owners and Hiring Facilities Association of Nigeria (TOHFAN), Alhaji Danladi Garba.
Awka, March 3, 2020 (MOI) Anambra State Commissioner for Health, Dr Vincent Okpala says the state has no case of Corona Virus (COVID-19), within its territory.
``I urge Ndi Anambra to go about their normal business, but step up observing normal hygiene in the state,’’ the commissioner said this while speaking with health correspondents in his office at the Jerome Udoji Secretariat Complex, Awka.
Dr Okpala noted that his ministry had put machineries in place to check contractors, businessmen and people coming in from affected countries in order to avoid having the disease in the state.
Holding such an inclusive event and bringing together key stakeholders and experts was a significant feat and the culmination of a long process from consultative meetings to policy recommendations.
The next action steps for stakeholders is further engagement with and support to the National Centre on Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM), constituted by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), to develop the National Policy on Agricultural Mechanisation.
telecom mastTelecommunications operators in the country have been handed a new order to either improve telephony services or face fresh forms of sanctions.
He urged Ndi Anambra to practice better hygiene by constantly washing their hands and to maintain clean environment in their various homes.
The Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof.
Umar Danbatta, gave the warning at the weekend in Abuja, insisting that operators must to do everything possible to improve service delivery to the consumers on their various networks.
The EVC, who spoke through the Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau (CAB), NCC, Felicia Onwuegbuchulam, said though the Commission recognizes the existence of some challenges confronting the industry, operators are expected to strive to always improve service for the over 175 million subscribers in the country.
“Where a service provider continues to fail to improve services to the detriment of the consumers, the Commission will apply appropriate regulatory actions and sanctions against such service provider,” Danbatta added.
Danbatta also affirmed that “in the course of regulating the industry, the NCC had always recognised the importance of the consumer in the telecom sector and the fact that consumers deserve to have value for the money spent on telecoms services.
There is no case of Corona virus in Anambra. We are on ground to respond to any eventuality.
According to the EVC, the empowerment and protection of the consumer from unfair practices of service providers and others is a central item on the eight-Point Agenda.
The NCC Chief Executive informed consumers to always call the NCC toll-free number 622 to lodge unresolved or unsatisfactorily-resolved complaints earlier reported to their respective service providers so that NCC can institute necessary intervention on their behalf for redress.
Danbatta also encouraged consumers to make use of the Do-Not-Disturb (DND) 2442 Short Code to control unsolicited text messages instead of just complaining about unsolicited messages.
He advised that instead of just complaining it is more profitable than consumers take advantage of the facilities and channels of redress provided by NCC to tackle the challenges of telecom services.
Danbatta also praised telecom consumers for their patronage and urged all citizens to support the Commission in its desire to address the challenges of telecommunication, expand telecom services and increase the sector’s contribution to the nation’s economy.
We are tackling Lassa fever and Corona virus together. I want to re-assure you that we have checked out all the Chinese in the state and they are free from disease for now.
Telecomunications subscribers nationwide lodged 19,977 complaints against Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) between January and October this year.
``From January to date we have examined five people that entered the state from China and they are all free from the disease,’’ he said.
The grievances, which were reported on four dedicated channels of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), had to do with billing; call centre/customer care; quality of service/experience, sales promotions and advertisement, among others.
Billing issues include an unexplained change in the account balance and the inability to change tariff plans.
Concerning customer care, subscribers decried their inability to connect to help lines; alleged nonchalant attitude of agents; incorrect response from agents and other infractions.
Regarding quality of service in respect of voice and data, telephone users complained of call interference; inability to receive calls; call divert; call barring; persistent data depletion; poor signal/no network to mention a few.
The about 179 million active subscribers in the country are to be protected, according to Sections 104, 105, and 106 of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003.
According to a document obtained from the NCC yesterday, the four channels through which subscribers laid the complaints include the commission’s Contact Centre (622); Consumer Portal against Service Providers; social media and correspondences.
Analysis by The Guardian of the document titled: ‘’Trend Analysis on Complaint Received from January to October 2019 in Consumer Affairs Bureau,’’ showed that for the period under review, 18, 717 complaints were received via the 622 channel; 764 through the consumer portal; 315 via social media and 181 written words.
Of the 19,977 complaints, NCC was able to resolve 13, 282 while others are pending.
Compared to 2018, there was a major leap in complaint resolution this year.
The Guardian checks showed that across the channels in 2018, about 40, 380 complaints were received, while 24,281 got resolved.
The regulator claimed an average of 96.66 percent complaint resolution rate as against 57.65 percent in 2018 just as the contact center confirmed a 39.01 percent improvement.
For complaints from the consumer portal, there was also a leap from the 65.5 percent record of 2018 to 88.07 per cent in 2019, representing a 22.57 per cent progress.
Progressively, the social media platforms advanced from 50.56 per cent in 2018 to 74.93 per cent this year with complaint resolution posting a 24.37 per cent improvement.
However, for petitions, the scorecard fell with the commission acknowledging 53.22 percent as against the 86.47 percent tally of 2018, indicating a 33.25 percent decline.
Speaking on the document, the NCC Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, explained that the exercise was geared towards harnessing extant policies, regulations and guidelines for the protection, information, education and empowerment of telecommunications consumers in Nigeria.
Dr Okpala noted that adequate measure was in place to check participants in the ongoing police Games in the state.
According to him, anyone who comes in from China should stay indoors for two weeks; if he has fever should report immediately to any health facility across the state.
The commissioner said that it was because of high surveillance that made it possible to detect a victim of the virus in Lagos.
There are processes and structures that have been installed to fish out anyone who is infected with the virus.
`Wash your hands regularly with soap, use hand sanitizers, keep a safe distance from anyone coughing or sneezing, avoid crowds and maintain good respiratory hygiene.
``Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow when coughing or sneezing, stay indoors, if you feel unhealthy with symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty in breathing,’’ he urged.
ANAMBRA 2020 BUDGET: ACCELERATING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, YOUTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP -- A CLARION CALL TO SUPPORT GOV OBIANO
In many societies, especially the under-developed, the bane of underdevelopment is usually poor human resource capacity, poor policy initiative and inadequate infrastructure to support and facilitate growth and development.
Inadequate infrastructure is also a result of poor policy formulation, faulty implementation of programmes as well as poor execution of projects.
At the mention of infrastructure development, the human mind readily goes to provision of access and motorable roads, regular electricity supply; provision of portable water.
Indeed, infrastructure means the basic facilities: services and installations needed for the effective and efficient functioning of a community, state or country. Consequently, the need for basic infrastructure cuts across all areas of human endeavour.
In Government, Budget is a statement or itemised summary of intended expenditures, usually coupled with expected revenue. The Budget is a social contract between the Government and the people. The budget, also spells out Government proposed recurrent and capital expenditures for a given period, usually a year.
The performance and success of a budget depends on the realisation of the projected revenue targets and their efficient and effective implementation.
[FILES] Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) governor Godwin EmefieleAccidentally, the United States central bank – The Federal Reserve – stumbled on a powerful monetary policy tool in the 1920s.
After the First World War, the new regional Federal Reserve banks found they had almost no financial relationship with the banks they were supervising in their regions.
The implication of this was that these Federal Reserve banks could not generate any revenues to carry out their most basic obligations.
[FILES] Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) governor Godwin Emefiele.
In a bid to find other ways of earning money, early in 1992, the Federal Reserve banks started buying government bonds from banks so they could at least earn some interest.
It soon discovered something interesting – as it bought the government securities from the banks, the banks’ reserves were boosted.
The second order effect of this was that interest rates started to come down as the banks all had more money to deploy.
Thus the Federal Reserve figured out that when credit was scarce and interest rates were high, it could buy up government securities from the banks to boost liquidity and lower those rates.
By extension the reverse was also true – when there was too much money in circulation and interest rates were too low, it could sell government securities to banks.
By May 1922, the Federal Reserve decided to formalize this process and create what was called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to coordinate how this new powerful tool was to be used and when.
These days Open Market Operations (OMO) is nothing new of course but in 1922 one can only imagine how innovative they were.
All of a sudden there was a market tool which could be used as a lever to control interest rates without having to use any other crude methods.
Over the last 100 years since the invention of this tool, Central Banks across the world have borrowed and deployed it in their own countries to achieve the same goal of managing the supply of credit in the economy and interest rates in general.
Until the coming of the Great Godwin Emefiele, Nigeria’s Central Bank governor, that is.
In the last 2 or so years in Nigeria, the meaning of OMO has been completely redefined.
The name remains the same and in the Central Bank’s annual activity report, it still says that the purpose of its OMO activity is ‘to moderate the excess banking system liquidity’.
On the face of it, that sounds like the same thing the US Fed discovered almost 100 years ago.
But when you dig deeper into what is going on in Nigeria, you see something totally different.
The first thing is to ask a simple question – how come CBN’s OMO involves foreign investors? Much of the securities being sold by the CBN to ‘mop up’ excess liquidity in the banking system is being bought by foreign investors.
Has the CBN finished mopping up the liquidity in Nigeria that it is now mopping up foreign liquidity as well? As anyone who has been following events knows, what happens is that the CBN sells securities to foreign investors at ‘mouthwatering rates’ that they cannot obtain elsewhere.
Since these foreign investors only have dollars and the CBN’s securities are denominated in naira, the CBN takes their dollars and exchanges it to naira for them.
At the same time, it gives them a cast iron guarantee that when they need their dollars back in 1 years’ time, it will sell it to them at an agreed rate no matter what the actual rate at that time is.
These investors then take their naira and buy securities from the CBN and count their interest for one year.
In 2018 alone, CBN sold a total of N22.4trn ($62bn) worth of OMO securities ostensibly to ‘mop up’ excess liquidity.
Anambra State before the advent of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) was marred by chaos, armed robbery attacks, kidnapping, threat to life and, property as well as looting of public funds.
Was there really that much money sloshing around the Nigerian banking system that needed mopping up? At any rate, there was hardly any movement in interest rates during the year since the CBN itself needed to keep them high to keep attracting foreign investors to buy the securities.
Herein is the final evidence that if the inventors of OMO were to reincarnate in Nigeria today, they would not recognise their own creation.
Nigeria’s OMO does not mop up excess liquidity and does not have any effect on interest rates.
So what is the best thing to call this redefined OMO? Nigeria owes the foreign investors who buy the OMO securities and it owes them in dollars.
The CBN has merely found a way to increase Nigeria’s external debt using what Diezani Alison-Madueke famously called ‘non transparent opacity’.
When you go to the Debt Management Office (DMO) website, what you see on the front page is FG’s share of Nigeria’s foreign debt that currently stands at $21bn.
As the CBN’s OMO is mostly short term for 1 year, it is hard to tell how much the outstanding balance is.
But whenever the CBN decides to make this figure public, we should be honest enough to treat it as what it really is by adding it to the figure of Nigeria’s external debt.
The Administration 1999-2003 was handcuffed, emasculated and strangulated to make way for celebrated looting of the Treasury, through the instrumentality of `Irrevocable Payment Standing Order’.
Mr. Michael Akinwale is the General Manager of Rally Trade, an international online broker.
This paved the way for Government activities to be hijacked, and the state legislature attacked on the orders of ``Political Godfathers’’. Salaries could not be paid. Ecological funds were not left out by the ravaging Political Godfathers.
In this interview with BENJAMIN ALADE, he speaks on opportunities in brokerage business, the need for Nigerians to have multiple streams of income and a regulatory environment for online brokers.
What is Rally Trade all about?.
Rally Trade is a financial service brokerage company.
We have a platform where people can trade in global financial markets.
It means looking at the global stock market- New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, French exchange, German exchange and other platforms where you can trade directly from Nigeria.
You can trade currencies, euro, pounds, and dollar.
We all know that prices from each country are always fluctuating, which means you can trade them against themselves to make money.
Lastly, commodities- gold, cocoa, aluminium, rubber, not in their physical form, but virtual form, are all on the market platform.
What do you see in Nigeria’s economy at the moment?.
Well, based on our own business, it is a good time to be in Nigeria and the reason is that we are going through a transition period.
We are in a serious problem now.
First, people that have one job will find that the job alone can’t help them again.
Secondly, there’s no job, even for young and old alike.
We are in a time where we should be creating opportunities to solve the problems.
This will mean creating several other sources of income that people never know about.
It is a good time to be in business because we are now helping people now to start making money from a source they never thought existed.
While I was in school, I didn’t know anything called trading, though it was existing, but because at that time, there was no technology to bring it here.
There was no Internet and mobile phone, so the trading could not come to Nigeria.
But now that the technology is here and everyone has a mobile phone, it’s a good time to be in the business.
Is the business related to foreign exchange trading?.
That word foreign exchange (forex) is just one part of the market.
If I say currency, I mean forex.
But somebody can be trading indices, that is not trading financial currency.
So, foreign currency is just a part of the market and the business we do, not the whole market.
What opportunities for this business exist in Nigeria?.
There is great potential.
For any young person, I see the business as a career.
There’s something about making money, but the other side is the career, something that you can be proud of and would want others to be part of.
What is the role of technology in business operations?.
Without mincing words, technology now is the bedrock of businesses.
Any company that is not technology-driven is headed for disaster.
Whenever we do our seminars, we always show people the fact that in the last 10 years, companies like Exxon Mobil, Shell, China Petroleum, were the biggest in the world then.
The biggest companies in the world now are Google, Microsoft, Apple.

Buhari Not Bothered About Criticisms By US, UK -Femi Adesina
He also said the Nigerian Government would pay no concern to the ultimatum issued by a group of civil societies.
Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to President Muhamadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has said the Nigerian Government was not bothered by criticisms from the United States, United Kingdom and European Union over human rights violations in Nigeria.
Speaking on Channels Television, Adesina said, “We are not answerable to the US, UK or EU.
We are Nigeria, a sovereign country. Those countries and entities have issues of their own. Let them deal with their issues. Let Nigeria also deal with her internal issues. We are not answerable to them.”	 	 
He also said the Nigerian Government would pay no concern to the ultimatum issued by a group of civil societies.	 	 
He said, “Genuine issues will be looked into. We have had instances in which the government had to reverse itself because there were concerns raised. It shows that the government is responsive but you cannot listen to a babble of voices. It will distract you from what you are doing.”	 	 
Adesina also said Prof Wole Soyinka, who had been a vocal critic of the lawlessness of the administration, was entitled to his opinion.	 	 
He added, “We respect Prof Soyinka. You don’t have too many of them in the country or even on the continent.	 	 
He is an avatar and he is well respected but his opinion will remain his opinion. It will be considered and if there are things to act on, we will act on them.”

Buhari Slowing Down Nigeria's Progress –Ondo Cleric
Speaking at a programme on Thursday in Akure, Giwa said the ruling All Progressives Congress government led by Buhari had made Nigerians regret voting them into power in 2015 due to its unfriendly polices.
Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ, a church based in Akure, Ondo State, Adewale Giwa, has said President Muhammadu Buhari was slowing down Nigeria’s wheel of progress of Nigeria following his continued silence on human rights abuses and violation of court orders under his watch.
Speaking at a programme on Thursday in Akure, Giwa said the ruling All Progressives Congress government led by Buhari had made Nigerians regret voting them into power in 2015 due to its unfriendly polices.
He said, “Nigeria is a blessed country but the leaders have failed to walk on God's paths.
“If you are not a wicked leader, you would not have been watching your tribe killing another tribe without bringing them to justice.
“If you are a good leader, you would not have jailed innocent people and allowed killers to move freely in the country.
“If you are a God-fearing man, you would have fulfilled all the promises you made during the electioneering campaigns.
This style of leadership is slowing down Nigeria's progress.”	 	 
Buhari’s Fight Against Corruption Profoundly Disappointing -Ex-presidential Adviser	 	 
A former political adviser in the Presidency, Dr Usman Bugaje, has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s fight against corruption as one that is profoundly disappointing.	 	 
Bugaje said this while speaking at the 25th anniversary of the Serikin Fulani of Lagos State, Dr Mohammad Bambado 11.	 	 
Bugaje also condemned the incessant attacks by Boko Haram sect in the country, incompetent politicians whose only way of winning is through manipulation of religion and ethnicity.	 	 
He said every Nigerian must be worried that the fight against corruption was being lost.	 	 
He stated, “The fight against corruption is to say the least profoundly disappointing.”	 	 
He urged the government to find lasting solution to rising unemployment in the country, saying if not arrested, it poses a big threat to the country, Daily Trust reports.	 	 
Buhari’s Secret Emissaries To Sowore Proved Mission Impossible By Bayo Oluwasanmi	 	 
President Buhari’s emissaries to Sowore proved mission impossible because the history of tyranny is also the history of its eventual defeat. The Great King of Persia was checked at Marathon and Salamis. Napoleon was checked at Waterloo. Hitler was checked on D-Day. The Soviet Empire collapsed.	 	 
Bayo Oluwasanmi	 	 
“The tyrant dies and his rule is over, the martyr dies and his rule begins.” -Soren Kierkegaard	 	 
Last week, Premium Times reported that President Muhammadu Buhari on two separate occasions sent secret emissaries to Omoyele Sowore in the Department of State Services’ gulag “to extract commitment from him to back down on the ‘revolution now’ protest as a precondition for his release”.	 	 
According to Premium Times, Sowore “rejected both attempts as extra-judicial and self serving, saying he would not take part in arrangement that would essentially lend legitimacy to unwarranted abuse of his fundamental rights and disregard of judicial authority.”	 	 
The negotiators included Isa Funtua, a close political associate of the President, Sam Amuka, publisher of Vanguard Newspapers, Nduka Ogbaigbena, publisher of ThisDay Newspapers, and presidential spokespersons Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu.	 	 
If President Buhari had obeyed two court orders that granted Sowore bail, there would have been no need for any emissary. I’m disappointed that Mr Sam Amuka was one of the negotiators. Amuka whose pseudonym is Sad Sam, was one of my favourite columnists when I was in high school. I expect Amuka to tell President Buhari that he should obey the rule of law by releasing Sowore immediately without any precondition. Well, for the other members of the team, I don’t expect anything different. They are interpreters of maladies doing the bidding of the President.	 	 
Buhari is the least morally qualified to ask Sowore to renounce #RevolutionNow in order for Sowore to secure his freedom as mandated by the court because Buhari is guilty of what he accused Sowore of. Indeed, Buhari’s statement of “blood and baboon will flow in the land” when he lost his third presidential election amounts to high treason.	 	 
It bears repeating that Buhari has uprooted our democracy. Buhari has brought back the ancient evils. Buhari’s authoritarianism is the only force challenging our society. Buhari is Nigeria’s “Catiline or Caesar” disguised as a reformed dictator or born again democrat.	 	 
Some tyrants were usurper, who came to power by their own efforts. Others were imposed by intervention from outside. Yet, some were elected. Buhari is an elected tyrant, a brazen bully with uncontrolled cruelty and self-indulgence. Buhari has dismantled the constitution, staged show trials for corrupt public officials, destroyed press freedom, jailed critics, empowered Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen terrorists. Our democracy has come and gone in a blink!	 	 
Nigerians need a space to complain about Buhari’s repressive regime. They need to express their views uncensored on how Buhari runs their country. They need to hold Buhari and other elected representatives accountable. They need to constantly remind Buhari that he is not a king. But with Buhari’s backing of Hate Speech Bill, he is telling Nigerians that they can bitch all they want in the kitchen or bedroom, but they can’t bring their complaints into the streets or into the open market place of ideas of social media.	 	 
Let’s remind the old despot that it was “Hate Speech” that propelled him to power. He should know that criticism is part and parcel of living in a democracy. It’s one of the major distinctions between a civilised country and a jungle of apes. On the orders of President Buhari, Sowore and Olawale Bakare have been in detention since August 3 and 5, 2019 respectively when they were arrested by the DSS.	 	 
President Buhari’s emissaries to Sowore proved mission impossible because the history of tyranny is also the history of its eventual defeat. The Great King of Persia was checked at Marathon and Salamis. Napoleon was checked at Waterloo. Hitler was checked on D-Day. The Soviet Empire collapsed.	 	 
Power is transient. “The tyrant dies and his rule is over,” Soren Kierkegaard reminds us, “the martyr dies and his rule begins.”	 	 
Buhari would be consumed by his own tyranny. Sooner than later his rule will end!	 	 
Central Bank Of Nigeria To Increase Charges On PoS Transaction	 	 
According to the CBN, the new policy stipulates 'Stamp Duties Payment' on individual transactions that occur on PoS, rather than previous plans where charges occurred on aggregate transactions.	 	 
The Central Bank of Nigeria has directed the strict implementation of Merchant Service Charge, which would impose more charges on all point of sale (PoS) transactions.	 	 
This is coming few days after the apex bank announced new charges on withdrawal and deposit of funds above N500,000.	 	 
The directive on the 'Unbundling of Merchant Settlement Amounts' was contained in the CBN circular to banks, processors and switches, titled: 'Review of Process for Merchants Collections on Electronic Transactions', The Nation reports.	 	 
According to the CBN, the new policy stipulates 'Stamp Duties Payment' on individual transactions that occur on PoS, rather than previous plans where charges occurred on aggregate transactions.	 	 
The circular signed by CBN Director, Payments System Management Department, Sam Okojere, authorised banks to unbundle merchant settlement amounts and charge applicable taxes and duties on individual transactions as stipulated by regulators.	 	 
The merchant service charge was also reviewed downward from 0.75 percent (capped at N1,200) to 0.50 percent (capped at N1,000).	 	 
The CBN and Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) are working closely, including setting emittance processes that ensure the stamp duty charges for PoS is collected.	 	 
Challenge Buhari's Excesses, Shehu Sani Urges Nigerian Youth	 	 
Sani said Nigeria’s hard-earned democracy was on the verge of collapse if the brazen impunity displayed by operatives of the Department of State Services was not immediately checked.	 	 
Former federal lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has called on Nigerian youth to rise up as one and challenge the excessive use of power by President Muhammadu Buhari.	 	 
Sani said Nigeria’s hard-earned democracy was on the verge of collapse if the brazen impunity displayed by operatives of the Department of State Services was not immediately checked.	 	 
The senator said there was the need for Nigerian youth to go beyond social media activism and physically be involved in engaging government on critical issues and speak truth to power.	 	 
Sani made the call in Abuja while speaking at the 2019 Human Rights Summit/Awards to commemorate International Human Rights Day.	 	 
According to him, the dwindling culture of activism among youths was as a result of misplaced priority.	 	 
He said, “We must appreciate the fact that our democracy was a product of struggle and sacrifice. People fought to restore democracy to Nigeria. People in power must not be allergic to criticism.	 	 
“No nation can aspire for greatness anywhere in the world if the basic issues of the rights of people are continuously being called for question.”	 	 
Change Or Risk Travel Ban, NAPTIP Tells Sex Offenders	 	 
Five persons are already on the list, including a reverend in Ekiti State.	 	 
Nigerians on government’s Sexual Offenders Register domiciled with the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, may be denied visas and travels to other countries as part of withdrawn privileges, a report by PUNCH said.	 	 
Five persons are already on the list, including a reverend in Ekiti State.	 	 
NAPTIP’s Director of Public Enlightenment, Mr Orakwue Arinze, said, “The register will let Nigerians know those who are paedophiles and abusers.	 	 
I cannot speak for embassies, but I know that no country will like to have a molester, a paedophile or a rapist walk into their country.
It is a minimum standard that is applicable in all countries. I know that even people who indulge in electoral malpractices are being denied travel authorisation in some countries, not to talk of convicted paedophiles, molesters and abusers.	 	 
“This is not peculiar to Nigeria. Sex offenders’ register is in operation in other parts of the world.	 	 
“The idea is for it to serve as a deterrent and there is no exception.”	 	 
On November 25, the Federal Government had inaugurated the Sexual Offenders Register, saying it would contain the names and pictures of those convicted for sexual abuse cases, including rape.	 	 
Vice-President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, had done the inauguration, while urging Nigerians to report cases of sexual harassments and abuses to the police for prompt action.	 	 
NAPTIP Director-General, Julie Okah-Donli, had noted that anyone arrested for rape would have their information displayed on the register.	 	 
Christmas: Police Ban Fireworks In Ondo, Threaten To Deal With Sellers	 	 
Adie Udie, Commissioner of Police in the state, gave the order on Friday.	 	 
The police in Ondo has banned the use of fireworks in the state during Christmas and New Year celebrations for security reasons.	 	 
Adie Udie, Commissioner of Police in the state, gave the order on Friday.	 	 
Femi Joseph, spokesperson for the police in the state, in a statement said the command was ready to deal with anyone who flouts the order.	 	 
He said, The Ondo State Police Command wishes to inform the people that the ban on the use of fireworks and other explosives during the Christmas is still in force.
Similarly, those who engage in the sale of these items are also warned to desist from such business as buyers, users and sellers are culpable under the law.
He added that the police was ready to secure the lives and properties of citizens and residents of the state during Yuletide.
Climate Change: Ministry Of Environment, Eko Carbon Exchange Partner To Reduce Emission In Nigeria
The initiative, which was announced during the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties in Madrid, Spain, also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.
I
In a bid to reduce the effects of climate change in Nigeria and indeed the entire African continent, the Federal Ministry of Environment and other government agencies have partnered with Eko Carbon Exchange to achieve the target.
The initiative, which was announced during the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties in Madrid, Spain, also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.
The UN Conference in Spain attracted African and international experts and sustainability actors including from Nigeria, who all discussed how to protect the continent from the harsh effects of climate change.
Managing Director of Eko Carbon Exchange, Mr Innocent Azih, disclosed that the initiative, being the first in West Africa, was mobilising to harness the opportunities in low-carbon development across all economic sectors in Nigeria, starting with solid waste and transport sectors.
He said this will also serve as a regional vehicle for mobilising finance for low-carbon economic development for West African economies through the Clean Development Mechanism.
Azih stated, “The objective is to mobilise the necessary resource pool and low-carbon finance required for greening all economic sectors.”
Head of Climate Change Mitigation in the Ministry of Environment, Hajia Aisha Jibril, revealed the readiness of the ministry to work with the Exchange to enable Nigeria achieve the nationally determined contributions through projects implementation that are fully mainstreamed.
She described efforts made by the ministry to include policy incentives, education and awareness of actors through climate change desks at state levels, to development of the Nigerian carbon emission registry.
She urged stakeholders to follow Eko Carbon Exchange’s lead and partner with the ministry to ensure early realisation of the registry.
Also speaking at the UN meeting, Chief Executive Officer of Natural Eco Capital, Dr Eugene Itua, in his submission noted that tremendous emission reduction programmes have been on in Lagos State through the replacement of outdated mass transport vehicles with more modern and energy-efficient buses.
Stakeholders noted that finance remained a major challenge to scaling green investments but suggested that the best approach was non-monetary strategy in which financing packages for low-carbon consumption comes with credit and insurance.
Closure Of Border Cannot End Smuggling, ECOWAS Tells Nigeria
Disagreeing with President Buhari, ECOWAS stated that the border closure would also affect the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Act signed by the country.
Nigeria Cameroon border
The Economic Community Of West African States has told the Nigerian Government that closing its border with other neighbouring countries cannot prevent the smuggling of goods and products into Nigeria.
President Muhammadu Buhari had announced the closure of the border, saying that it would prevent bringing products into the country illegally and also help boost the patronage of locally made products.
Disagreeing with President Buhari, ECOWAS stated that the border closure would also affect the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Act signed by the country.
In a statement on Tuesday, the bloc said,“The ECOWAS Parliament calls for compliance with community provisions and the reopening of borders and a coordinated fight against smuggling in the region.
“The root causes of this recurrent situation must be studied with a view to finding a permanent solution.”
Comparing Omoyele Sowore's #RevolutionNow To Boko Haram Insurgency, A Needless Escalation By Kayode Ogundamisi
Now is the time for the government to stop the disobedience of court orders, no one is above the law including activists and people in government but if you must prosecute Sowore and others then let it be open, free and transparent. Otherwise, thus far the state has made a mess of the case, this is looking more like persecution than prosecution. If the government has a thinking cap on, it will #FreeSoworeNow or at the least let the case in court continue without infractions.
Kayode Ogundamisi
I read the statement by the Presidency on the Sowore/Bakare treason trial. This statement is a needless escalation, particularly the comparison with Boko Haram insurgency. If the allegations are completely true, why is the Department of State Services disobeying court orders? One would think the state will be eager to bring its evidence to the open.
If the Presidency and the DSS are confident of Omoyele Sowore's ability and capabilities to "violently overthrow the government", why can't the state simply let the judicial process proceed without interference as seen in the agency’s disobedience of two court orders and the recent show of force by carrying out an arrest when you could have easily invited Sowore or picked him up at his residence in Abuja with a court warrant?
The President Muhammadu Buhari government is making a grave mistake, attracting negative local and international commentaries, a distraction the government does not need at any time, particularly now. Now is the time for the government to stop listening to the voices of chaos and start listening to the voice of reason.
The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), should review the Sowore and Bakare’s case file and do the needful (drop the treason charges) and if the state is confident of its case, then let the case proceed in a transparent and open manner.
When Sowore committed what was an obvious infraction such as defacing a public property in Lagos, an offence that could get an easy conviction in a Lagos environmental court, the government looked the other way, a sign the state isn't interested in enforcing our laws but to bring up charges with stringent conditions that can drag on for long and keep alleged offenders in jail awaiting trial for a long period. The treason charges the state is now relying on is unlikely to stand in an open trial, thus the request for a secret trial and anonymous witnesses.
Sowore's followership on social media run into millions of people who find it easy to 'comment' 'like' 'follow' his broadcasts, but no evidence the millions have translated into a mass movement.
Nigerians are disappointed, angry and have always wanted a change but not reckless enough to follow an unplanned idealistic ‘revolution’ with no road map, even the DSS should have known this. The danger to Nigeria isn’t the Sowore and his group, the government should review how the intelligent agencies arrive at largely fictitious ‘security reports’.
Now it is the Nigerian Government and the DSS that are promoting #RevolutionNow by aiming to kill a fly with a nuclear bomb with attendant negative impact. It is the government now ascribing some imaginary powers to Omoyele Sowore and his armless group, a sign of insecurity on the part of the government.
Each infraction by the government will attract more sympathy. It is the case of David against Goliath. Give this group a designated space to protest and a platform to vent and you will see not all Nigerians agree with some of the solutions being proffered by the group.
Omoyele Sowore and his group are being lionised by the state. Nigeria's elite security is now acting like a gangster enforcer. The government should review its so-called counter-insurgency strategy and stop applying failed tactics.
The irony is that the government already had half of what it wants legally by securing one of the harshest bail conditions against a suspect. The judge had in a ruling on October 4 granted Sowore bail in the sum of N100m and two sureties in the same amount and barred him from travelling out of Abuja. Why rearrest Sowore when he's already restricted to Abuja? Is the DSS saying it does not have the capability to mount surveillance on one man in Abuja?
For the record, I am no supporter of #RevolutionNow, I have seen how recklessness can destabilise fragile states but evidence of alleged infractions is better presented in court without the state acting as if it is insecure and desperate to keep a voice in detention by all means, necessary, including bending the law.
Now is the time for the government to stop the disobedience of court orders, no one is above the law including activists and people in government but if you must prosecute Sowore and others then let it be open, free and transparent. Otherwise, thus far the state has made a mess of the case, this is looking more like persecution than prosecution. If the government has a thinking cap on, it will #FreeSoworeNow or at the least let the case in court continue without infractions.
Dammy Krane Granted N50,000 Bail By Court
He was arraigned at the Igbosere Magistrate Court in Lagos over a three-count allegation bothering on breach of public peace.
Hip-hop artiste, Johnson Oyindamola widely known as Dammy Krane, has been granted bail in the sum of N50,000 with one surety in like sum.
He was arraigned at the Igbosere Magistrate Court in Lagos over a three-count allegation bothering on breach of public peace.
The musician was accused of making statements capable of breaching public peace and threatening the lives of staff of Merrybet Gold Limited on July 25.
According to the prosecutor, the offence contravened sections 301, 412 and 168 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him by the police.
His lawyer, Adebayo Oniyelu, while applying for his bail, said the defendant was “a well-known musician who had not been convicted of any crime in the past”.
He also said that the defendant would not interfere with the prosecution of the matter if granted bail, noting that Dami Krane had been in prison custody since Friday.
Opposing the application for bail, prosecuting counsel J. I Enang, said he ordinarily would not have objected to the application for bail if it were not a national issue.
But when asked how the case was a national issue, Enang said it would be revealed at the right time.
He said, “Your Honour, while coming to court today, I already heard it on the radio that a musician was to be arraigned today, it is even an international issue.”
Interjecting, Oniyelu informed the court that the case was one of breach of contract.
“The musician performed for the complainant and they are owing to him N1m.
“He reached out to them to request for his money but they refused to listen to him, forcing him to go on air to say that they were owing to him. The next thing that happened was his arrest.”
The magistrate, A. F. O Botoku, adjourned the matter until October 11 for the commencement of trial.

A member of one of Nigeria’s legendary music groups, Danfo Drivers – Oghenemaro Emeofa popularly known as ‘Mad Melon’, has died.
According to the management of the group in a statement, the artiste died on Wednesday night after a brief illness.
The statement said, “The management of Mad Melon and Mountain Black aka Danfo Drivers, wishes to announce to the general public the passing of Oghenemaro Emeofa aka Mad Melon.

Dangote Flour Mill Shares Suspended On Floor Of Stock Exchange Ahead Of Takeover
This will be the second time the company will get sold in the last seven years after it was bought by South Africa-based Tiger Foods in 2012 and returned three years later.
The Nigeria Stock Exchange on Tuesday effected a full suspension on the trading of shares of Dangote Flour Mills as a precursor to its delisting and takeover by Crown Flour Mills.
This will be the second time the company will get sold in the last seven years after it was bought by South Africa-based Tiger Foods in 2012 and returned three years later.
“The suspension is imperative to prevent trading in the shares of the company beyond the effective date of the scheme of arrangement for Crown Flour Mills Limited to acquire the entire issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 kobo each in DFM held by scheme shareholders, subsequent to which the company would be delisted from the main board of the NSE,” a statement from the NSE said.
 The board of directors of the company had in April received an offer from Olam – the parent company of Crown Flour Mill for the sale of the company.
The firm and the board agreed to pay N130bn for five billion worth of ordinary shares listed by DFM.
The board proposed to make the offer to its shareholders on August 5 through a high court ordered meeting that was scheduled to hold on October 14.
Tiger Foods sold DFM back to Dangote in 2015 for a single dollar after it had acquired the company for $200m.
The company had made losses in the years it was owned by the South African firm.
DFM again announced that it made a loss of N1.16bn just before it agreed to sell the firm to Olam.
Experts say Olam’s acquisition of the staggering firm is an attempt to expand its influence in the country’s confectionery space through Crown, which it purchased in 2010.
Dangote Flour Records Negatives In Q3 Result
Highlights of the group’s third quarter result indicates that the company lost N6.84bn.
Dangote Flour, which is soon to be sold to Crown Flour – a subsidiary of Olam, is piling up losses for its coming investors.
Highlights of the group’s third quarter result indicates that the company lost N6.84bn.
The wheat milling firm earned N76.75bn in the quarter ending September 30.
It had previously netted in revenues worth N83.29bn in the period ending June 30.
This is a loss of 7.85 per cent.
Proshare reports that the firm’s loss before tax increased by 316.75 per cent to N9.64bn.
Its loss after tax soared by 309.69 per cent to N6.84bn.
The firm’s net asset also decline by 28.97 per cent to N39.
It’s before tax losses was occasioned by increased cost of sales, distribution and administration.
In April, the board of directors of Dangote Flour approved a 100 per cent take over from Olam.
Dangote sold over 60 per cent of the company’s stake to South Africa-based Tiger Foods in 2012.
That relationship lasted for three years.
It climaxed in Africa’s richest man repossessing his firm for just a dollar.
In 2013 and 2014, Dangote Flour was on the loss trail.
Its scorecard in 2018 amounted to a deficit of N1.16bn.
Experts have said the firm is not strategic to the Dangote Group, hence its laggard performances and double change of ownership in six years.

Death Of A Nation: Biafra and the Nigerian question By Chido Onumah
“There are two basic questions that must be answered by all Nigerians. One, do we want to remain as one country? Two, if the answer is yes, under what conditions?” – Chief Bola Ige
Introduction: To paraphrase the historian, mathematician, journalist, Marxist, and progressive thinker, Edwin Madunagu, every political history has its significant dates, landmarks or turning points. In Nigeria’s political history, for instance, landmarks would include October 1, 1960, (the day Nigeria gained independence from Britain), January 15, 1966, (when the first of what would become a tradition of military coups occurred), July 6, 1967, (the official start of the 30-month Nigeria-Biafra war) and January 15, 1970, (the official end of the civil war).
To these dates, I will add January 1, 1914, (the amalgamation of the Southern and Northern Protectorates by the British to create Nigeria), May 27, 1967, (the beginning of state creation in Nigeria), and May 30, 1967, (the official declaration of the secessionist state of Biafra). The latter dates, May 27 and May 30, 1967, are significant in many ways. On May 27, 50 years ago, Yakubu Gowon, who served as head of state of Nigeria from 1966 to 1975, perhaps in anticipation of the audacious move by the Military Governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Lt. Col. Emeka Ojukwu, announced the division of Nigeria into 12 states from four regions. The division of Nigeria into 12 states and Ojukwu’s declaration of Biafra were decisions that would change the country forever.
Gowon’s action did not only alter the structure of Nigeria, it led to the reconstruction of the nascent nation through the lenses of the so-called Nigerian military; a military that was provincial in outlook as it was ill-equipped for leadership. The military centralized economic and political power and moved Nigeria from a federal republic to a unitary state. In many ways, we can conveniently say May 27, 1967, was the day Nigeria began to unravel and any attempt to understand the current crises and our inability to make progress as a nation must necessarily return to the action of the military junta on May 27, 1967.
The road to Biafra
Three days later, May 30, 1967, Lt. Col Ojukwu, a Nigerian soldier of Igbo extraction declared an “independent sovereign state of the name and title of the Republic of Biafra,” officially excising the Eastern Region from Nigeria. Ojukwu based his action on the resolution, four days earlier, on May 26, 1967, of a joint conference of the Eastern consultative assembly and leaders of thought that asked him to declare the Eastern region as a separate republic at an “early practicable date”.
The declaration of Biafra was the culmination of a series of tragic events. First was the bloodletting that started with the January 15, 1966, military coup. That coup led to the assassination of Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Belewa, the country’s first and only prime minister and Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Premier of the Northern Region, among other high-profile casualties. Some recollections by Edwin Madunagu in “Settling account with Biafra” (The Guardian, May 4, 2000) are apposite here: “One, the politics of the First Republic (1960-1965) was heavily characterized by ethnicity, especially towards the end of that tragic period. Two: Of the five army majors that are more frequently mentioned as leading the coup attempt, only one, Major Adewale Ademoyega, was non-Igbo by ethnic origin. Three: No Igbo political leader died and the only Igbo military casualty occurred not because he was a target but because he was considered a ‘nuisance’. Four: The attempted coup was the culmination of a long period of political crisis in Nigeria, a crisis whose centre of gravity was Western Region where, before the military intervention, the crisis had become an armed popular uprising.”
On July 29, 1966, there was another military coup led by officers from Northern Nigeria and Lt. Col Yakubu Gowon became head of state. According to Madunagu, the coupists “first made a move to pull the Northern Region out Nigeria, but when they were advised that they were now in a military situation to rule the whole country, instead of a part of it, they dropped the idea of secession and became champions of ‘One Nigeria’. Lt. Col Ojukwu refused to recognize Lt. Col Gowon as head of state.”
The second coup led to the assassination, among other high-profile casualties, of the country’s first military head of state, Gen. Aguiyi Ironsi, an Igbo, as well as the military governor of the Western Region, Lt. Col. Adekunle Fajuyi. This was followed by, as Madunagu notes, “mass killings not only in the North but all over the country, except the Eastern Region. Now, multiply the May 1966 tragedy by a factor of 50, add to it the fact that the killings were now led by armed soldiers whose commanders were now in power and add to this the fact that the killings did not abate for at least five months and you begin to have an idea of what happened.”
The criminal indifference of the Nigerian state to the manifest pogrom against people from Eastern Nigeria, particularly Igbos, the repudiation by the Nigerian contingent (and the “unilateral implementation” by the Eastern regional government) of the agreement on decentralization of power reached at a meeting in Aburi, Ghana, involving the main protagonists, Yakubu Gowon and Emeka Ojukwu, at the instance of Gen. Ankrah of Ghana, finally paved the road to Biafra.
The accounts of what took place in those turbulent days are as varied as there are ethnic groups in Nigeria. But one thing is certain: the effects of those events, particularly the actions of May 27 and 30, 1967, are still being felt today. In one fell swoop, the military unilaterally restructured Nigeria according to its dictates. While Ojukwu drafted “unwilling” minorities in the Eastern Region to create a Biafran state where Igbos were in the majority, the Nigerian military which was nothing but the armed wing of a reactionary feudal class that had power thrust on it at independence began the implementation of an agenda of conquest. Interestingly, barely a year earlier, the section of the military that seized power after the January 15, 1966 coup had attempted to reconstruct Nigeria as a unitary state with the promulgation of the unification decree 34 of 1966. That attempt was opposed fiercely by those (including a section of the military) who felt they had lost out in the power equation. The rest is history.
When history repeats itself
Unfortunately, Nigeria is on the cusp of that tragic history repeating itself. Regrettably, 50 years after the declaration of Biafra many young Nigerians of Igbo descent are trying to recreate Biafra. In a few days, there will be events in Nigeria and around the world to mark the 50th anniversary of the declaration of Biafra on May 30, 1967. Forty-seven years after the end of the Nigeria-Biafra War, Biafra still resonates with individuals and groups within and outside the country; perhaps, a testament to the fact that the war hasn’t ended in the minds of the protagonists and victims and the reality that many of the issues that propelled the civil war are still with us today.
So, how do we deal with this conundrum? Is Biafra the solution? In other words, can we solve the problems of 2017 Nigeria using the tragic solution of 50 years ago? As S.M. Sigerson noted in The Assassination of Michael Collins: What Happened at Béal na mBláth? “A nation which fails to adequately remember salient points of its own history is like a person with Alzheimer's. And that can be a social disease of a most destructive nature.”
Seventeen years ago, Edwin Madunagu, in the piece referenced above, admonished “the young Nigerians now threatening to actualize Biafra (to) forget or shelve the plan. In place of ‘actualisation’, they should, through research and study, reconstruct the Biafran story in its fullness and complexity and try to answer the unanswered questions and supply the missing links in the story. This is a primary responsibility you owe yourselves: you should at least understand what you want to actualise. If 30 years after Biafra, you want to produce its second edition, you need to benefit from the criticism of the first. History teaches that a second edition of a tragic event could easily become a farce—in spite of the heroism of its human agencies. On the other hand, those who enjoy ridiculing Biafra—instead of studying it—are politically shortsighted. My own attitude to Biafra is neither ‘actualisation’ nor ridicule. I propose that accounts should be settled with Biafra.”
Madunagu’s admonition needs no elaboration. It is clear enough for the young people pushing for the actualization of Biafra, many of whom were born after the end of the Biafra war 47 years ago. The aspect of his position on Biafra that I want to focus on is the aspect that warns of the “political shortsightedness of ridiculing Biafra”.
Balkanizing the nation
When the military regime headed by Gowon divided Nigeria into 12 states, it sought to weaken the prospect of the different groups in the Eastern Region uniting against the Nigerian state. Of course, that action was music to the ears of minority groups, particularly those in the Eastern Region, who had long demanded their own state. With the creation of states, however, the military not only unilaterally abrogated the geo-political structure that existed then, it went a step further to destroy the principle of federalism on which Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and which had sustained and kept the country together. We need to understand that this principle was adopted not only to assuage the fear of domination by a single group in the country but as recognition of the differences (multi-ethnic and multi-lingual) of the various “ethnic nationalities” that were brought together to create Nigeria.
Part of Gowon’s broadcast on May 27, 1967, signaling the breakup of Nigeria into 12 states is pertinent here: “The main obstacle to future stability in this country is the present structural imbalance in the Nigerian Federation. Even Decree No.8 or Confederation or ‘loose association’ will never survive if any one section of the country is in a position to hold the others to ransom.
“This is why the first item in the political and administrative program adopted by the Supreme Military Council last month is the creation of states for stability. This must be done first so as to remove the fear of domination. Representatives drawn from the new states will be more able to work out the future constitution for this country which can contain provisions to protect the powers of the states to the fullest extent desired by the Nigerian people.
“As soon as these are established, a new revenue allocation commission consisting of international experts will be appointed to recommend an equitable formula for revenue allocation taking into account the desires of the states. I propose to act faithfully within the political and administrative program adopted by the Supreme Military Council and published last month. The world will recognize in these proposals our desire for justice and fair play for all sections of this country and to accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country.
“I have ordered the re-imposition of the economic measures designed to safeguard federal interests until such time as the Eastern Military Governor abrogates his illegal edicts on revenue collection and the administration of the federal statutory corporations based in the East. The country has a long history of well-articulated demands for states. The fears of minorities were explained in great detail and set out in the report of the Willink Commission appointed by the British in 1958. More recently, there have been extensive discussions in Regional Consultative Committees and leaders-of-thought conferences. Resolutions have been adopted demanding the creation of states in the North and in Lagos. Petitions from minority areas in the East which have been subjected to violent intimidation by the Eastern Military Government have been publicized.
“While the present circumstances regrettably do not allow for consultations through plebiscites, I am satisfied that the creation of new states as the only possible basis for stability and equality is the overwhelming desire of the vast majority of Nigerians. To ensure justice, these states are being created simultaneously. To this end, therefore, I am promulgating a decree which will divide the Federal Republic into 12 states. The 12 states will be six in the present Northern Region, three in the present Eastern Region, the Mid-Western will remain as it is, the Colony Province of the Western Region and Lagos will form a new Lagos State and the Western Region will otherwise remain as it is.”
What the military regime of Gowon gave with one hand it took with the other. And that would become the hallmark of subsequent military regimes in Nigeria. Gowon failed to realize, or deliberately ignored the reality that the issue wasn’t the division of the country but the reluctance or inability of the military to keep its promise, viz., “This must be done first so as to remove the fear of domination. Representatives drawn from the new states will be more able to work out the future constitution for this country which can contain provisions to protect the powers of the states to the fullest extent desired by the Nigerian people.”
Unfortunately, that never happened. It couldn’t have, considering the rapacious and parasitic nature of the Nigerian military so-called and the interest it represented and still represents. Once the military couldn’t deliver on that promise, it also meant that the second part of its declaration that, “The world will recognise in these proposals our desire for justice and fair play for all sections of this country and to accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country,” was nothing but meaningless soundbite by a rampaging military sub-class in desperate search for legitimacy.
Since then, there has neither been “justice nor fair play for all sections” of Nigeria. There hasn’t been any serious attempt to “accommodate all genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country.” The sham of a federation that the military created has evolved into a Frankenstein's monster. Fast forward 50 years. Cleary, it is the nebulous federal government that is holding the country to ransom. The moment the military government took economic powers from the states, there was no way we could ensure justice and fair play. And once you can’t ensure justice and fair play, there is no way you can stop the concomitant disquiet.
The politics of state creation
When Gen Murtala Muhammed created additional seven states—three in the “South” and four in the “North”—bringing the total to 19 states, and a new federal capital territory, Abuja, on February 3, 1976, ten days before his assassination on February 13, he left no one in doubt that the conquest was real. While Gowon showed an inclination to balance Nigeria geo-politically, Muhammed ensured that the “North” had ten states while the “South” had nine. It has been alleged that the decision was to create four new states in the “North” and four new states in the “South”, but when Muhammed announced the creation of states, instead of creating two states (Cross River and Akwa Ibom States) out of the old South-Eastern State, he simply announced the transformation of South-Eastern State into Cross River State.
Subsequent military regimes continued the conquest, not just on the political front, but on the economic front as well. Ten years later, in 1986, when the self-professed evil genius, Gen Ibrahim Babangida, set up a Political Bureau to review the country’s political and democratic system, one of its recommendations was the creation of an additional state (Akwa Ibom State) in “South” to create a geo-political balance of ten states each between the “North” and “South”. Babangida spurned that recommendation. He did create Akwa Ibom State, but he added another state (Katsina State) in the “North” to maintain the imbalance. It was the same pattern that was adopted in subsequent state creation in 1991 (under Gen Babangida) and 1996 (under Gen Sani Abacha). Geo-politically, today, Nigeria is composed of 36 states: 19 states in the “North” and 17 states in the “South”.
Ordinarily, this should not matter. After all, in a federation, the federating units (states) are supposed to manage their affairs substantially and contribute to the sustenance of the Federation. Therefore, only those who feel their states can sustain themselves would clamor for the creation of such states. Of course, more self-sustaining states would mean more opportunities for the national government to benefit from the exploration and exploitation of resources in every state. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Nigeria.
In a country where the military had hijacked and centralized the control of economic resources and political power by, for example, arrogating to itself the authority to create local governments as well as placing itself in the position of chief dispenser of funds based on its own criteria, including population, land mass, number of local governments, derivation principle, etc., the dog eat dog demand for states was inevitable. Thanks to the military—the armed wing of Nigeria’s dominant power bloc—Nigeria has a weird federation where states can’t create their own local governments; where local governments are listed in constitutions that have been nothing but military decrees writ large. Thanks to the military, Nigeria has spurned justice and fair play and disregarded the genuine aspirations of the diverse people of this great country.
It is not for nothing that Nigeria is described as a federal republic. It was a choice made by the three regions in Nigeria preceding independence. Both the Eastern and Western regions obtained internal self-government (independence) in 1957, while the North got same in 1959. Each region could have opted to go its own way in 1960. We could have had three countries as opposed to one at independence. The decision by the regions to be part of a shared territory called Nigeria came with some obligation and expectation. There is little to suggest that the federating region were willing to jettison the greater part of their economic and political independence for the sake of “one Nigeria”.
In 1963, the regions (the precursor of our current states) controlled 50 percent of the revenues accruing from their region; today we are quibbling whether the states have right to as little as 13 percent. In a sense, this manifest heist by the federal government has perpetuated injustice in some sections of the country while condoning indolence in others. It is this quest for control or lack of, that is at the heart of the Nigerian crisis.
Biafra of the mind vs Biafra of the field
What is Biafra? If that question was tough to answer in 1967, it is even more difficult today, fifty years after. As a nation, Biafra was going to be difficult to sustain even if it had been actualized. Was Biafra a nation made up of ethnic nationalities? In other words, was Biafra a microcosm of Nigeria? One of the things those who are agitating for Biafra have not been able to define or communicate effectively is an answer to the question: What is Biafra? The answers to this question are as varied as there are agitators.
There are those who will tell you that Biafra encompasses the area that used to be the Eastern Region of Nigeria and beyond, including parts of Southern Cameroon and stretching to Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Some define Biafra as simply the former Eastern Region of Nigeria that was given the name Biafra on May 30, 1967. Some say it is the five states (Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo) in south-east Nigeria where the Igbos are the major ethnic group. Yet, others define Biafra as encompassing all the Igbo-speaking areas of southern Nigeria, including parts of present-day Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Benue States. The issue of definition is important because the lack of understanding and agreement can pose great problems.
Of course, up until May 30, 1967, there was nothing like Biafra as nation or political territory. The only thing that bore the tag Biafra was a bight off the West African coast, in the easternmost part of the Gulf of Guinea, stretching to Cape Lopez in Gabon, over which Britain established a colonial protectorate in 1849. Biafra as a nation was a child of circumstance that would become a child of necessity.
What if the bloody January 15, 1966, coup and the attendant assassinations didn’t happen; if Igbo political leaders had been killed alongside their counterparts from the “North” and “West”; if the “revenge coup” of July 29, 1966, and the attendant murders didn’t occur; if the Nigerian state had reined in the murderous groups (military and civilian) that had targeted Igbos after the July 29 coup; if Gen Aguiyi Ironsi—the first indigenous general and leader of the Nigerian Army—an Igbo who was not part of the January 15 abortive coup, had not been a major beneficiary by seizing power and becoming head of state; if Gen Ironsi had executed the coup plotters ofJanuary 15 as military tradition dictates; if the regime of Gen Ironsi did not promulgate Decree No. 34—which abrogated the country's federal structure in exchange for a unitary one; if the “January 15 boys” had completed their “project” either by one of them becoming head of state or as some have alluded, released the imprisoned leader of the national opposition, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and installed him as prime minister; if the Nigerian government led by Gowon had implemented the agreement reached at Aburi?
The secret police had stormed the place to effect the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, who was standing trial in a case brought against him by the Nigerian Government.
Sowore was first arrested on August 3, 2019 by the DSS for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The government is accusing him of insulting President Buhari and planning to bring down his regime.
He was rearrested by the DSS on Friday less than 24 hours after being released on bail after 125 days in detention.
Chairman of Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Opeyemi Bamidele, moved the motion for the probe of the court invasion by the DSS.
Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, instructed the committee to begin legislative procedure on the matter and report next week.
Public Bus (BRT) Currently Burning On Third Mainland Bridge In Lagos
According to an eyewitness, the blue bus, which was heading towards Iyana-Oworo, caught fire just after Adeniji Adele axis of the bridge with the disaster resulting in chaos and heavy traffic gridlock
There is chaos on the third mainland bridge right now as one of the buses used for the bus rapid transit (BRT) in Lagos is currently burning on the bridge.
According to an eyewitness, the blue bus, which was heading towards Iyana-Oworo, caught fire just after Adeniji Adele axis of the bridge with the disaster resulting in chaos and heavy traffic gridlock.
It is unclear if there have been any casualties from the incident.
The officials of Lagos fire service and LASTMA are desperately trying to put out the fire and ensure order in the area.
Queen’s College Student To Face Disciplinary Panel Over Artificial Eyelashes
The college’s Parents-Teachers Association have condemned the girl’s mother seen in a viral video harassing a security guard of the school because her daughter was punished, according to The Nation.
Queen's College was founded as a girls' school in 1927 during the colonial era
The Cable
More details have emerged about what transpired in the viral video of a Queen’s College pupil harassed out of the college for wearing artificial eyelashes and painting her nails.
The college’s Parents-Teachers Association have condemned the girl’s mother seen in a viral video harassing a security guard of the school because her daughter was punished, according to The Nation.
The girl had resumed two weeks late after midterm on Monday and was being punished for wearing artificial eyelashes and painted nails.
However, unknown to her teachers, her mother was watching but did not identify herself.
Trouble started when she attempted to drag the girl out of the school and the security man (not knowing she was the mother) challenged her.
The mother reacted by attacking the security guard.
A source said, “The girl was returning to school two weeks after the mid-term had ended.
“When the teachers saw her with eyelashes and painted nails, they asked her to kneel down.
“Her mother came in with her, sat down and listened but did not say anything.
“Someone heard her telling her daughter in Igbo that she should run away. But the girl refused. After the third time, the mother grabbed the girl’s bag and made to leave.
“When people realised that she was the girl’s mother, she quickly dragged the girl out. The security man did not did not know it was the girl’s mother dragging her out.
“In an attempt to ask why she was taking one of our students out, that was when she attacked the security man.
“The girl was even remorseful. She was asking the mother why she was disgracing her.”
The source said the girl was returned to school by her mother on Tuesday and would face disciplinary measures.
The source added, “The woman came to drop the girl around 5:00am in the morning urging her to sneak into her class. But the girl did not sneak. She stood by the security gate till morning and presented herself to the school management. A man who claimed to be her father came to the school to apologise on her behalf but we found out that he is not her father.
“She will face the disciplinary committee. Many people – including the state, are now interested in the case. So we are investigating.”
In a statement, the Caretaker Committee of the College’s PTA noted that the association was in support of the school management’s position on discipline.
The statement reads: “We condemn in totality the action of the parent. We stand by the management in enforcing discipline in the school.
“However, the Committee will invite both the parent and the student with a view to ameliorating the situation and preventing a repeat of similar occurrence.
“The lesson we need to take home on this is simply that Queen’s College will not tolerate violation of its well settled rules and regulations.”
Questions Amaechi Should Answer On Transportation University By Olabisi Deji-Folutile
Honestly, Nigeria should concentrate on building its research capacity and developing innovative curricula that will help its students develop the crucial skills of creativity and critical thinking. These are some of the things that can make Nigeria relevant in the development space.

I never believed Nigeria was serious about starting a Transportation University until Monday when President Muhammadu Buhari and other government officials commissioned the project in Daura, the President’s home town. The university, according to Transportation Minister, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, is a response to the question of how Nigeria would maintain and manage its railway infrastructure. The reason given notwithstanding, the whole gamut of excitement that characterized the groundbreaking ceremony, suggests something else. Going by the way the minister resorted to insults and vituperation on Nigerians that dared to query the rationale for establishing the university in the President’s home town; it appears the project was borne out of political contingency than any other reason.
Besides, Amaechi stole the show at the ceremony that ordinarily should have been organised by the ministry of education and the National Universities Commission in conjunction with the Transportation ministry. From the minister’s excitement, it is as if the transportation university is the best thing that has ever happened to Nigeria in recent times. He boasted about how he forced the China Civil Engineering Construction Company to undertake the project by refusing to sign the contract for Lagos/Ibadan Rail project and how he also forced the company to take some Nigerians to China for training in railway technology. The minister spent more time justifying the establishment of the university in Daura, than he did on the usefulness of the institution. The Director of Rail Services of the Federal Ministry of Transportation, Mohammed Babakobi, didn’t help matter, as he too, was more concerned about why the university must be in the President’s town.
Amaechi’s action, reminds me of the popular Yoruba adage that says forcing a man to get married is not a big deal, but making him to make provision for the family is the real work. Beyond constructing a university structure, there are numerous questions that Amaechi must answer to convince Nigerians that he understands what he is doing. For example, he needs to come clear on who owns the university and the institution that is funding it. Is it to be fully funded by the Chinese government or partly funded by the Federal Government? The only reason why anybody should be excited about a transportation university in Nigeria at a time like this as far as I am concerned is if the CCECC is fully running it as a gift to Nigeria. But, if all that CCECC is doing is to construct a university as part of its corporate social responsibility, then Amaechi’s display of a sense of achievement is totally misplaced. Having a Transportation University is the least of Nigeria’s problems. If government wants to develop transportation, what stops it from expanding transport departments in existing universities? The Institute of Transportation in Zaria is there as well as many others. The Federal Government could have simply increased the capacity of existing institutions to provide better manpower and training in the sector.
For me, it doesn’t make any difference where the university is sited. I believe the current administration has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that it does not have any iota of regard for federal character. President Buhari showed the direction his administration would follow with his very first set of appointments and he has continued on that path ever since. So, there is no point dissipating energy on something that is not likely to change.
The reason given by President Buhari for establishing the Transportation University is even more interesting. According to him, the university will bring rapid development to the nation’s transport sector and generate both academic and non-academic employment opportunities to Nigerians. How can a Federal Government struggling to fund its 43 universities be on an adventure of establishing more? A lot of people, including our leaders, know that Nigeria’s federal universities are nothing to write home about. This is one of the reasons why you are not likely to find children of the President, governors and other political leaders in these universities. Many of the university administrators are struggling to cope. Recently, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Ibadan, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, revealed that what the university was getting as overhead was less than N100m, whereas it needs a minimum of N800m for overhead. The VC wondered where universities were expected to get money from when reacting to lawmakers’ call for cancellation of admission fees in Nigeria’s tertiary institutions. The VC said what the university gets from the Federal Government in one year is not enough to fund it in a month.
How soon can this Transportation University catch up with the rest of the world on rail technology? When several countries are operating driverless trains and efficient underground rail system, Nigeria is still struggling to construct surface rail systems. The coaches here still run on the oldest technology and unfortunately for the country, its President thinks the aim of creating a university is to get people to be employed. The Texas Central train will soon be transporting riders on the 240-mile trip from Dallas/Fort Worth to Houston in less than 90 minutes, making it the fastest train in North America. Going by the way we develop in Nigeria, it could take forever for the university to be relevant to the rail business. Technology will definitely keep evolving and it is almost certain that our leaders won’t do what it takes to make the university relevant.
Engaging in high research and experimentation is one of the hallmarks of universities all over the world. How much budget does Nigeria devote to research in its universities? As of today, Africa, as a continent, produces one per cent of research technologies in the world. Tackling this problem should be of more importance to the giant of Africa than turning universities to a constituency project. As rightly noted by the African Research Universities Alliance, Africa can’t speak about development until it has the capacity to generate its own knowledge.
The rest of the world is concerned about how African universities are preparing students for the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) calling for more doctoral training. The challenge is lack of innovation and technologies that can solve the continent’s problems. For those who will argue that this is the essence of establishing Transportation University, I challenge them to tell Nigerians where they hope to get the academic staff that will run the university from. Are they going to be sourced from this current university system that is suffering from dearth of academic staff? There are reports of universities renting staff to get their courses accredited by the National Universities Commission. The NUC cannot claim to be ignorant of this phenomenon. A lot of lecturers in public universities work in private universities and vice versa. The NUC, for instance, has a template for the minimum number of PhDs that universities should have in each department, how many Nigerian universities meet this requirement? How many universities in Nigeria are producing PhDs on annual basis? I know UI produces the highest number of PhDs annually but I doubt if it could produce up to 500 per annum. The last figure I knew was around 250 per annum.
Honestly, Nigeria should concentrate on building its research capacity and developing innovative curricula that will help its students develop the crucial skills of creativity and critical thinking. These are some of the things that can make Nigeria relevant in the development space. China is one of the few countries in the world controlling over 80% of research innovations. The Federal Government should commit more resources into funding research activities and capacity building. Universities are not secondary schools. We don’t need this proliferation!

Questions For The Nigerian Left By Edwin Madunagu
Edwin Madunagu
Edwin Madunagu
My most recent published article, “Recalling Tai Solarin’s prediction”, which appeared in the first week of this month, ended with a series of questions. I reproduce four of them that are most relevant to this sequel: “Why is it that despite the Nigerian Left’s insistence, at least since 1979, on the inevitability and irreducibility of a Revolutionary Party, the party has not emerged? Why should we find ourselves repeating the same theses and propositions after every bloody and farcical display called “election”? How has Nigeria’s ruling class been able to periodically renew itself, assume new organizational forms and continue its rule? Put differently, why has it not been possible to overthrow Nigeria’s ruling capitalist class, as a class, or dislodge it as the dominant political force?”
The day after the article appeared, a comrade, Wumi Raji, who is a Leftist academic at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, called me on phone. After the usual pleasantries, he respectfully “complained” that my article ended abruptly, that he had expected me to answer or begin to answer the questions I posed. As I was about to suggest a time for us to discuss the answers on phone, he expressed preference for a written response – perhaps a sequel to the previous article. Finally, he “requested” that the sequel should not take too long in coming. When he asked what I thought of his “request” I told him bluntly that I did not understand what he asked me to do as a request, that I understood it as a comradely order which, coming, in particular, from his generation, I could not turn down.
Wumi Raji did not give me any space in our brief telephone conversation to say something that I would have liked to say, namely, that my questions were drafted as open questions to the Nigerian Left. They were not drafted as an introduction to a “lecture” which, perhaps, I was preparing to deliver; nor were they rhetorical questions (which demand no answers) nor exam-type questions (which demand answers from entities that exclude the examiner). In any case, what, practically, should I or could I do now, I asked myself at the end of my discussion with Raji. The answer, which came a day later, was that I could expand the questions and supply explanatory notes to some of them. If I perform these minimum tasks well, I would have begun to contribute to discussions leading to answers.
If the four questions I have reproduced here are combined, they translate to a loud and angry regret that since the end of Nigeria’s Civil War in 1970 and particularly since the 1979 general elections with which the Second Republic (1979-1983) was inaugurated, a sufficiently strong Leftist Revolutionary Party has not emerged in the country to frontally and seriously challenge the ruling capitalist class. This serious and frontal challenge would have been either for power or for the dominant political position in the country or, minimally, for a significant shift in the balance of socio-political forces in favour of the working and toiling masses of Nigeria. This regret about what could have happened—but did not, or had not happened—now translates back to a single question, Why?
In my view, a view shared by many Leftists, the major reasons for the non-emergence of a Revolutionary Party, sufficiently strong to frontally and seriously challenge Nigeria’s ruling capitalist class may be broadly separated into two segments: the objective and the subjective. We may defer the objective reasons. But of the subjective reasons, the most prominent is what I had described as “differences within the Nigerian Left”. (The Guardian, October 4, 2018). This important factor will be our focus in the rest of this piece. It is on account of the differences within the Left that I have insisted, in the last two years, on the production and dissemination of a People’s Manifesto. My reasoning is that in the process of producing and disseminating the People’s Manifesto (The Left platform) the differences that many Leftists presume do not exist, or are not serious, will emerge and be engaged.
It is, of course, expected that the Manifesto—which in the process of production and dissemination will begin to resolve our internal differences—will first appear as a robust draft document that attempts to take precise positions on some critical questions before the masses and the nation. The draft may begin with a Preamble or Introduction: Who we are, what we propose to do, the agency of the revolutionary transformation and the social forces of the transformation. It may then go on to Popular-Democratic Ideas (constitutional and republican democracy, the rule of law, the state and the people, socioeconomic rights, political rights and civil rights). It may then proceed to Strategy of the Revolutionary Transformation; Democratic Governance; Philosophy of Governance and Principles of State Policy; SocioEconomic Restructuring; The National Question, National Unity and Geo-political Restructuring; National Independence and Foreign Policy. The document should, of course, end with a Transitional Programme (immediate agenda).
My current position on each of these proposed elements of a Peoples Manifesto has been explicit in my published articles of the past two years. But a particular sensitive subject—the National Question—requires further explanatory notes here. Nigerian Leftists, especially Marxists, know or should know that neither theory nor history has resolved what Marxism knows as the National Question—from the standpoint of Marxism. Had it been resolved—even if badly—we could have been more confident to take positions on the tragic things that happened within the leaderships of the ruling communist parties of the former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia and former Czechoslovakia and to the countries and peoples over whom they ruled for decades. If there were a near-settled Marxist position on the National Question the enduring ethnic question in China (since the 1949 Revolution) would not have remained an embarrassing issue for Marxists and socialists everywhere.
If the history of Marxism had handed us a resolution of the National Question, we would have been bolder in taking positions on what happened between Ethiopian and Eritrean Marxists and Leftists in the last quarter of last century. And coming home, if we had a near-settled theory or if Marxism had substantially advanced the debate on the National Question since the Russian Revolution and the Third International, Nigerian Marxists would today be bolder to take positions on what happened to the Nigerian Marxist Left during the Nigerian Civil War and on the status of current pro-Biafra Nigerian Marxists. I do not know how many living Nigerian Marxists followed and still remember the public “national question” debate between two leading Nigerian Leftist intellectuals: Comrade GG Darah and the late Comrade Yusufu Bala Usman about a decade ago.
Let me end the present piece with the following poser: Before, during and after the Russian Revolution, a Marxist tendency closely connected with Lenin introduced “national oppression” as a “Marxist category, related to class oppression but not identical with or subordinate to it”, whereas in that period, Rosa Luxembourg, who requires no introduction, stood (and still stands) “at the apex of the attempt to make operational the Marxist concept of class as the primary social referent, and to break once and for all the old alternative stranglehold of nation”. From this poser I propose that Nigerian Leftists, especially those of Marxist orientation, should advance the debate on the National Question and Geopolitical Restructuring in Nigeria with the twin-objective of arriving at a common position in Nigeria and simultaneously contributing to the further development of Marxism on this question. This effort will also, simultaneously, advance the process of founding a nationwide Revolutionary Party that is substantial, authoritative and respected.

Rain Destroys Shelters For Displaced Nigerians
According to NRC's assessments, over 6,800 people living in
displacement camps in Maiduguri have been impacted by floods in recent
weeks. In Dikwa, 500 people have been rendered homeless due to
flooding and have set up home in disused registration centres.
Torrential rain has destroyed makeshift tents and caused severeflooding to temporary displacement camps in northeast Nigeria, leavingvulnerable families homeless.The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said it was worried about thesituation and thus appealed for "urgent financial assistance" toaddress the colossal humanitarian needs and to prevent the spread ofdeadly cholera.“Displaced people are suffering due to relentless rains and windbattering their homes the last few days. Large numbers of families,who fled from conflict months ago, are left homeless while others areforced to share overcrowded tents with neighbours or relatives,” saidEric Batonon, Country Director for NRC in Nigeria.According to NRC's assessments, over 6,800 people living indisplacement camps in Maiduguri have been impacted by floods in recentweeks. In Dikwa, 500 people have been rendered homeless due toflooding and have set up home in disused registration centres.“They are essentially displaced within a displacement camp,” Batonon added.“My home is completely destroyed. My floor has turned to mud and wateris everywhere. The rain keeps coming and we do not have any choice butto wait for it to stop or share with others,” said displacedmother-of-four Fatima Mohammed (30).The Adamawa State government, the organization said, had officiallydeclared an outbreak of cholera in three local government areas duringthe rainy season.The total number of cases reported as of August 16 stands at 633.Four people have so far lost their lives to the disease. Due to recentheavy rain and flooding, more cases could be confirmed over the comingweeks, the NRC pointed out.“Displaced people are living in sub-human conditions across theregion. There are no sanitation or drainage facilities in most camps.People are going to the toilet in open spaces because there are nofacilities for them to use and now that the camps are filled withstagnant floodwater, water-borne diseases like cholera quicklyspread,” Batonon added.Meanwhile, the United Nations and partners have appealed for $848million to address the needs in northeast Nigeria this year. Abouteight months into the year, less than 40 per cent has been received.“Additional financial support is urgently needed to reach the 6.2million people targeted for humanitarian aid in 2019. People will dieif they don´t receive urgent assistance now,” Batonon said.Furthermore, heavy rain periods present opportunities by armed groupsto infiltrate and target displacement camps.On Tuesday night (August 20) in Dikwa, a female suicide bomberdetonated a bomb, killing herself and injuring four civilians.This was the first attack of its kind in the area since December 2018.
RE: DSS And The 6th December Federal High Court, Abuja Incident By Lucky Ighoyota
The invasion of the Federal High Court on Friday by DSS operatives to perfect a rearrest of Omoyele Sowore and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, less than 24 hours after they were granted bail is the highest act of sacrilege against the judicial arm of government that the operative has constantly expressed contempt for.
On Saturday, December 7, 24 hours after the debacle at the Federal High Court, Abuja, the Department of State Services prevaricated about the real fact just to offset its damaged reputation.
It is no surprise to us or the general public, who are now used to the DSS' novelties of historical records of numerous lies m intended to create a false or misleading impression.
The invasion of the Federal High Court on Friday by DSS operatives to perfect a rearrest of Omoyele Sowore and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare, less than 24 hours after they were granted bail is the highest act of sacrilege against the judicial arm of government that the operative has constantly expressed contempt for.
After willfully violating two different court orders that granted bail to Omoyele Sowore, and until Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu's 24-hour ultimatum to the operative, it became an obvious fact that the compliance with the court order was with the ulterior motive of releasing and rearresting Sowore, just to be seen to have obeyed the pending court.
During the court proceeding of the day under reference, defence counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), intimated the judge of the intention of the DSS to rearrest Sowore, but it was overlooked.
However, as soon as Sowore was about stepping out of the courtroom, DSS operatives laid hands on him to rearrest him without a charge; hence, the pandemonium between the violent operatives of the DSS and supporters of Sowore who couldn't comprehend the justification for a rearrest barely 24 hours after his release.
Eyewitness and media accounts have it that the DSS operatives stormed the courtroom violently and disrupted proceeding for which the sitting judge, Justice Ojukwu, had to scamper for safety.
In the press release of the DSS, it accused Sowore's supporters of shielding him from an "imaginary arrest." But in reality, the rearrest already proved that it wasn't an imaginary arrest.
Since Sowore's appearances in court over this case with the DSS, armed operatives of the service in the court premises on December 6 were greater in number than ever. This is to show that Sowore's rearrest was a decision reached by the service even before his release on December 5!
On the claim by the DSS that its operatives were not inside the courtroom to carry out the rearrest, a critical look at the videos in circulation by the media and eyewitnesses revealed that some men of the operatives not dressed in DSS' branded uniform dragging Sowore on the ground inside the courtroom.
One of the service men inside the courtroom to forcefully rearrest Sowore was Marshall. He was not dressed in the branded uniform of the DSS. He was in a black jacket as seen in all videos in circulation.
Marshall was always the DSS operative restraining Sowore from speaking with the press during his previous appearances in court.
Also, it is worthy to note that Sowore while still within the premises of the court told this same Marshall that he was a disgrace.
With this fact alone, it is abundantly clear that after 24 hours of silence over the court debacle by the DSS, in a bid to salvage their publicly damaged reputation, they still couldn't manufacture a "smart lie" that serves to make amends.
It is unthinkable of the DSS to accuse Sowore of addressing a group of persons at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, on the same day of his release of a "reassured cause" to create anarchy in the country.
This allegation is spurious, bogus, fake, and inauthentic.The DSS intends to make the public think something that is not true.
In other words, the DSS is trying to establish the basis for rearresting Sowore to be that he had violated one of his bail conditions. This is laughable!
It is on record that when the DSS earlier insisted on validating the sureties to Sowore's bail, Justice m Ojukwu asked the counsel to the DSS if the agency was running a parallel court.
Most reasonably now, if a bail condition has been violated, it is of the same court that gave the conditions to determine that. The bail conditions were not by the DSS but by the court.
By DSS' inconsistent actions, the agency has assumed both the role of the court, the law, and the judge in this matter. This is a tragedy and a travesty of justice.
DSS' historical records of numerous lies, human right violations, court contempt, and the recent desecration of the court all speak of one truth, which is, the operative is unabashedly unruly and does not have the genetic composition to abide by the law.
There is no plan by any one group connected to Omoyele Sowore to organise an insurrection in the country. A wise saying has it that the evil that men do live after them. DSS' unequivocal reputation for false alarms is a psychological self-defense mechanism to preempt the provocative paranoia their oppressive tendencies are stirring in Nigerians.
The agency is gradually militarising our democracy by its undemocratic actions and terrorising assaults on dissenting voices of truth.
We are requesting well meaning Nigerians to lend a voice of opposition to this assault on our democracy, institutions, and freedom of expression as enshrined in our constitution.
Also, we are demanding the unconditional release of Omoyele Sowore from illegal detention.
Reactions Trail Genevieve's Lionheart Movie Oscar Disqualification
“Lionheart” is among the 10 African films that were submitted for Oscar consideration this year. Since this news broke, there have been arguments for and against the decision by Oscar.
Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first-ever submissionfor best international feature Oscar consideration, “Lionheart” hasbeen disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.The panel said the movie had "too much English dialogue".The movie which was directed by ace Nollywood actress, GenevieveNnaji, according to the Los Angeles Times ran afoul of the academyrule which states that an International feature film category musthave “a predominantly non-English dialogue track.”“Lionheart” is among the 10 African films that were submitted forOscar consideration this year.“This isn’t the first time the academy has disqualified a foreign filmfrom consideration for having too much English dialogue; in recentyears, the 2015 Afghan film, Utopia, and the 2007 Israeli movie, TheBand’s Visit, were disqualified for the same reason,” Los AngelesTimes reports. Since this news broke, there have been arguments for and against the decision by Oscar.Giving her reaction, an American filmmaker, Ava Duvernay wondered whythe movie was disqualified when the official language of Nigeria wasEnglish.In a tweet on her official Twitter handle she wrote: “To the academy(Oscar), You disqualified Nigeria’s first-ever submission for BestInternational Feature because its in English. But English is theofficial language of Nigeria. Are you barring this country from evercompeting for an Oscar in its official language?”In her response to Ava Duvernay’s tweet, Genevieve Nnaji said: “I amthe director of Lionheart. This movie represents the way we speak asNigerians. This includes English which acts as a bridge between the500+ languages spoken in our country; thereby making us one Nigeria.“It’s no different to how French connects communities in former Frenchcolonies. We did not choose who colonized us. As ever, this film andmany like it is proudly Nigerian.”For Nigerian actor, Deyemi, he chose to see the positive side, saying:“I can only imagine how many more views Lionheart will have on Netflixby the end of today! Anyhow you look at it this is a win! Staywinning.”“To think that some Nigerians actually complained that Lionheart hadtoo much Igbo! Only for the Oscars to think it has too much English?Total BS! Honestly, I don’t even care for the Oscars at this point!They might as well change the name back to 'Foreign language'," aTwitter user, Steven Chuks, stated.

Recalling Tai Solarin’s Prediction By Edwin Madunagu
Does it mean that nothing has changed fundamentally in Nigeria’s social order or in the Leftist challenge to it, or both? How has Nigeria’s ruling capitalist class been able to periodically renew itself, assume new organizational forms and continue its rule? Put differently, why has it not been possible to overthrow Nigeria’s ruling capitalist class, as a class, or dislodge it as the dominant political force?
Edwin Madunagu
Nigeria’s 2019 elections, particularly the recent governorship contests in Kogi and Bayelsa states, have forcefully brought back a prediction which the late Tai Solarin made about 40 years ago in the aftermath of the 1979 elections. Of course, recalling this prediction is also recalling my response to it at the time. I was then 33.
It is appropriate to begin any story I might wish to tell here by introducing Tai Solarin to young Nigerians who were not born when the prediction was made. This set of Nigerians now constitutes the majority of the Nigerian population. Tai Solarin was a prominent Nigerian male from South-Western Nigeria who was a secular humanist and educationist, but whose humanism was exceptional because it was all-round (that is, in thought as well as in action), consistent, courageous and well-informed.
Tai Solarin was not a Marxist, not a communist and not a worker by class placement. But he was a proletarian in lifestyle. In politics he would be described as a progressive, but not a progressive in the mould of the present-day Nigeria’s neofascist “progressive”. Tai Solarin was a progressive in the original sense of being located in the Leftist ideological and political universe. He was, in general, a “social critic” and, in particular, a critical, popular and respected newspaper columnist.
Now to the beginning of this piece. We may recall that Nigeria’s Second Republic began on October 1, 1979 after a 13-year period (1966-1979) of military rule that witnessed a civil war. In the general elections that ushered in the Republic, Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) emerged as (Executive) President and Obafemi Awolowo of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) emerged as the second strongest presidential candidate. The result was, to say the least, very contentious—as we can recall or research. But the issue here is neither the contentiousness of the result of the presidential contest nor the side which Tai Solarin supported. (He was a member of the UPN). Rather, we are concerned with his prediction five weeks into the new Republic.
On November 4, 1979, 34 days after the installation of President Shehu Shagari, the Sunday edition of the Tribune newspaper carried a column by Tai Solarin titled The Stolen Presidency. In it the columnist wrote: “If this government lasts four years … the four-year-old NPN will have been firmly planted as Government Party everywhere, and the UPN, the GNPP, the NPP and the PRP will have been drained to annihilation, both in membership—it is already starting—and in morale. The 1983 election would therefore be between the NPN and the Revolutionary Party which, having studied how the NPN came to power knows exactly what to do to supplant the NPN for the presidency. There would then be a confusion on the national raft. Then a splash. Then commotion among the sharks. And we, the common people, will have, as victims, paid the supreme sacrifice”.
My comment on this prediction was immediate—as was expected in those days. It appeared in an edition of the Nigerian Chronicle, a daily newspaper owned and published by the Cross River State government. The comment was later revised and included in the text of a lecture I delivered at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in November 1980 under the auspices of the institution’s Alliance of Progressive Students (ALPS) on the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the killing of Nigerian miners at the Iva Valley Mines, Enugu, by the colonial police. And later still, in May 1981, the comment was included in a book which emanated from the lecture. The lecture as well as the book that emanated from it were titled: Human Progress and Its Enemies: The Struggle for a more humane social order in Nigeria.
In the book, I said, “Tai Solarin’s prediction is unusual in two ways. In the first place, Tai Solarin was predicting the disintegration and demise of his party, the UPN. In the second place he was predicting that it would require a Revolutionary Party to dislodge the NPN from power: a type of prediction that normally comes from a revolutionary and not a liberal. We may ignore Tai Solarin’s scenario—for the Revolutionary Party, when it emerges, will not fight according to the rules fashioned by the enemies of progress. But we agree completely that the NPN, as a political party, is today the best organization of the Nigerian bourgeoisie and the most accurate reflection of Nigerian bourgeois interests. So long as the bourgeois social order remains so long will the NPN (or a new monster it may give birth to) continue to be the dominant political organization of the bourgeoisie.”
It follows from above that “only a revolutionary agency, representing the true aspirations of the popular masses (the workers, the peasants, students, etc.) and fighting consistently for an entirely new social order, can ever dislodge the NPN from power. To that extent—and to that extent alone—we agree with Tai Solarin. But we do not share his pessimism. A revolution cannot be conceived in a pessimistic perspective. A revolution—to use the words of Leon Trotsky—is incompatible with pessimism and other forms of spiritual collapse. Tai Solarin’s pessimism arose from the fact that he made a separation between the people and the Revolutionary Party—a type of separation that exists between the people and the existing political parties. A genuine revolution can only be made by the people under the leadership of their revolutionary organization, and such a revolution demands the highest forms of optimism and moral courage.”
Looking now at this nearly 40-year old “exchange” between Tai Solarin and myself, it strikes me that I could myself not have realized its full import. Tai Solarin said only a Revolutionary Party could dislodge the NPN from power. I agreed with him but amended the proposition by replacing “NPN” with the phrase “NPN or a new monster it might give birth to”. This suggests that I had a “flash” that NPN could be succeeded by another party—or another entity—but nonetheless, a “monster” (such as a military junta) organically emerging from NPN. But the “flash” was not pursued.
It is clear that the class perspective was missing from Tai Solarin’s analysis and prediction. This is explicable, given that he was not a Marxist. But my response was also not sufficiently ideological. Let me explain. In political-ideological contestation, even in our own context, the terms “bourgeois” and “capitalist” are not simply interchangeable. The absence of “capitalist” in my “disquisition” qualifies it as petty-bourgeois, even if revolutionary. If I had adopted a more appropriate ideological posture I would have stated explicitly that what I was alluding to was the removal of the capitalist class, as a class, and not just its political organisations like the NPN.
Having said this, the questions now are: Why is it that for almost 40 years, I have periodically—after every major election or change of government—felt the way I felt following the 1979 general elections and Tai Solarin’s prediction? Why is it that despite the Nigerian Left’s insistence, at least since 1979, on the inevitability and irreducibility of a Revolutionary Party, the party has not emerged? Why should we find ourselves repeating the same theses and propositions after every bloody and farcical display called “election”?
Does it mean that nothing has changed fundamentally in Nigeria’s social order or in the Leftist challenge to it, or both? How has Nigeria’s ruling capitalist class been able to periodically renew itself, assume new organizational forms and continue its rule? Put differently, why has it not been possible to overthrow Nigeria’s ruling capitalist class, as a class, or dislodge it as the dominant political force?

Reflections On Cold War And Africa’s Human Progress By Phumlani Majozi
In contrast to 30 years ago, the world is a better place in consideration of almost all the metrics of human development including economic growth, healthcare, access to education, and human right. This rate of progress is unprecedented in human history. My colleague at African Liberty, Alexander Hammond, has done incredible work on global human progress for the Cato Institute.
Unsurprisingly, it’s only after the Cold War that we have seen extraordinary advancements in technology and declines in global poverty rates. But before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world was divided. While Russia led the Soviet Union on a mission to turn the world into a communist paradise, the United States (US) invested huge resources to stall the Soviet Union’s communist ambitions. The two countries, Russia and the United States, had distinct philosophical worldviews; communism and capitalism. Because of their differences, they both exploited many resources to advance their ideologies to every corner of the globe.
The clash of these ideologies has resulted in incessant global instability, which negatively affects almost all regions of the world. Multilateral institutions like the United Nations became an ideological battlefield for the two powers.
In that tumultuous period in human history, none of us benefited; in fact, things became worse for much of the developing world with political dysfunction fuelled, in part, by the Cold War. Today, sadly, people tend to underestimate the harm that was done by this global ideological standoff that lasted decades. Could it be due to short memories?
Well, the African continent was one of the Cold War battlegrounds. My homeland, South Africa, was one of the victims of the Cold War. One of the reasons why it took us longer to end apartheid was because global powers saw our struggle against apartheid in the Cold War lens; Americans viewed Nelson Mandela as a communist and they believed his outlawed political movement, the African National Congress, was funded by Moscow.
The US and Britain were conflicted about the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, hence, when we talk about the history of South Africa's black struggle against apartheid, we should not isolate it from the dynamics of the Cold War.
The Cold War raged on for years in Zaire — now the Democratic Republic of Congo — as the country endured crisis after crisis. The political turmoil that culminated in Patrice Lumumba’s brutal death in 1961, usually called the Congo Crisis, was in part, fuelled by the power struggle between Russia and the US. The corrupt Mobuto Sese Seko who took power in 1965 and ran Zaire to the ground, was supported by the United States for most of his tyrannical rule because he was an ally against the Soviet Union.
The above Cold War cases on South Africa and the DRC, and on many other fronts in Africa, caused enormous political and socioeconomic damage to the continent.
The end of the Cold War put the world in a new, positive direction. A more cooperative world led by the US. The results of the formation of this new world were astonishingly a boon for human progress.
Speedy advancements in technology and globalization have cut global poverty to less than ten percent. Today, most women have the opportunity to go to school, and child mortality has reduced by more than half. Global healthcare has generally improved. Equally, experts seem to agree that we now live in the most peaceful times in modern human history. But it is Africa that still lags behind on fundamental measures of human development in the post-Cold War era.
African countries have failed abysmally to liberalise their economies; they still rank at the bottom of the Heritage’s Index of Economic Freedom. Civil conflicts, dictatorships, and corruption have continued unabated. Although global poverty rates may have declined since the early 1990s, Africa’s rates remain incredibly high compared to other regions of the world.
Having gone through one of its rough periods in history, Africa needs a pro-market revolution. The revolution needs people that are willing to put their countries first, not their personal interests. Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, recipient of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, is one of the people we must look up to in moving Africa forward. The Cold War is now history. And history is history; there’s not much we can do to change it. All we can do is to learn from it and use it as a guide to a better future.

REPORTER'S DIARY: 'Who Did You Come To See?' — A Visit To The 'Racist' Shi Shi Chinese Restaurant In Lagos
On arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate. "Good afternoon," we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard. "Who did you come to see?" he queried. Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: "Is this not a restaurant?" The security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.
What better place to have lunch than a restaurant accused of racism?
SaharaReporters visited Shi Shi Chinese restaurant on Thursday due to multiple allegations of racism towards Nigerian visitors to the restaurant, located at 21B, Emina Crescent, off Toyin Street, Ikeja, Lagos.
Our Experience
On arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate.
Good afternoon, we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard.
Who did you come to see? he queried. Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: "Is this not a restaurant?"
The security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.
The team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out).
The entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible. There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather. We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant. Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books). She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants/waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there.
In the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us. A member of the team turned back and requested with an assertive voice: "Can I see your menu?" The announcement was to deflect from our main mission there.
We were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area. As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.
The Wait
As we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea. By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.
She beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us. The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording. I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone. Sigh.
We continued to have conversations and our food began to arrive, the Chinese fried rice first.
In a bid to what I perceive as remedying our awkward ‘glance lock’, ‘Camera lady’ approached our table and offered to teach us how to use chopsticks.
Please note: while I was preoccupied with documenting our experience with a secret recorder, the team noticed that the two Asian men who were seated and had made their orders "looked disgusted, got up and made their way into one of the many rooms" in the restaurant.
The Show Must Go On
And so it began, the overly choreographed friendliness, niceness, half-smiles and forced response to questions. Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks. A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me.
I wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move? Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes). As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors.
She walked up to us and said "hello" and stayed there. A member of the team asked for her name and she said Si Si and introduced herself as the manager of the place. One member of the team queried if "everyone is welcome here?" to which she simply said "yes".
She then proceeded to accompanying us out the front door (again, what establishment has its manager see customers to the door?). As we exited the building, I noticed the security guard (seemed like a Nigerian from his looks) looked jittery. I couldn't let it go, so I went back to take a photo in front of the building. How else would we prove we came to eat racist spaghetti?
It turned out the manager was watching from the glass window I described earlier; she hadn't anticipated our abrupt return for a photo.
More suspicious was the security guard, who suggested I use a wall with some flower pots for the photo as opposed to standing by the entrance which had the name of the establishment carved into it.
In the End
From our findings, interaction with staff and management, we couln't help thinking that Shi Shi resturant is indeed racist, hence the security guard’s inquiry about who we were looking for in a place listed as a public restaurant even on Google. There was also the issue of the staff recording a video of us, the policing while in the restaurant and the manager accompanying us out. Would they have done all that if we were Chinese?
In the restaurant's bid to gloss this over, it ended us awarding us an exaggerated reception.
Reps Order Repair Of Terminal Receiving Vehicles At Apapa Port
The House instructed the Nigerian Ports Authority to immediately repair the quay wall of the facility and carry out a much needed infrastructural upgrade at the Tin Can port as well.
Daily Trust
The House of Representatives has ordered the repair of the terminal at Apapa port complex in Lagos responsible for receiving vehicles legally imported into the country.
The House instructed the Nigerian Ports Authority to immediately repair the quay wall of the facility and carry out a much needed infrastructural upgrade at the Tin Can port as well.
Sponsor of the bill, Benjamin Bem, said the poor state of the facility was costing the country loses of N600bn annually.
Bem said, “The House is worried that the collapse of the quay wall (retaining wall) and the apron area of the terminal, which has the length of 438 meters, could lead to closure of the only terminal that receives vehicle cargos from across the world into Nigeria being closed and loss of huge revenue accruable to government and loss of jobs to many Nigerians.”
While noting that the actual operation of the terminals have been privatised, Bem observed that it remains the duty of the ports authority to build and upgrade the infrastructure.
REVEALED: NFF 2nd VP Masterminded Backdoor Inclusion Of DSS DG’s Son Into Nigeria’s U-17 Squad To Stop Corruption Case Against Him
Sources have revealed how Second Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Shehu Dikko, masterminded how Bichi’s son was smuggled into the final team list submitted by coach Manu Garba to FIFA despite his name not being on the 50 players provisional list.
As the inclusion of Abba Bichi, son of the Director-General of the Department of State Services, in Nigeria’s squad for the Golden Eaglets U-17 team in the ongoing FIFA U-17 World Cup continues to generate buzz, more details have emerged how the inclusion of Bichi’s son was facilitated.
Sources have revealed how Second Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Shehu Dikko, masterminded how Bichi’s son was smuggled into the final team list submitted by coach Manu Garba to FIFA despite his name not being on the 50 players provisional list.
SaharaReporters had published how top NFF officials coerced Garba into selecting Bichi and even threatened him if he does not give-in to the request.
It was revealed that Garba had expressed doubt in the ability of the young lad to break into the team.

Also, to accommodate Bichi’s son into the team, Garba had to drop one of the regulars in his team.
However, fresh facts have revealed that Dikko hatched and implemented the plan with the support of some NFF officials.
Multiple sources disclosed to SaharaReporters that Dikko came through with the plan to seek favour on his corruption case with the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
The ICPC is investigating Dikko and some other executives of the NFF for financial malpractices and diverting funds meant for the association.
The ICPC in September obtained a court order to seal a house belonging to Dikko in Rivers State.
“The inclusion of DSS boss’ son was to get favour and goodwill.
Dikko carried out the plan so that he and other NFF executives undergoing investigation by EFCC and ICPC would be free.	 	 
“This was perfectly planned out at a time NFF is under intense watch and investigation,” sources said.	 	 
NFF President, Amaju Pinnick; First Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi; Dikko; and another executive member, Yusuf ‘Fresh’, are all facing corruption case in a 17-count charge on misappropriation of $8.4m belonging to the football body.	 	 
The NFF executive members had been ordered to appear in court on November 5 2019, which is the next adjourned date for the case.	 	 
Meanwhile, the NFF had claimed that Oduko was selected by the coach because of his understanding of the game and skills, countering claims that he was dropped for a fellow teammate.	 	 
“Bichi is a striker; Oduko is a left-back.	 	 
Oduko was dropped for Charles Etim. Oduko was the player that lost the kick in the shootout with Guinea in the semifinals of the U17 AFCON in Tanzania, which condemned Eaglets to the third-place match,” said NFF media officer, Demola Olajire.
The Golden Eaglets had played two matches in the ongoing tournament but Bichi is yet to feature in the competition.
Rivers Police Explain Closure Of Port Harcourt-Aba Road Since March 9 Elections
The action was meant to "protect INEC office situated between Waterlines and GRA bus stops, its personnel and electoral materials in the office”.
The Police Command in Rivers State has said the continuous closure of the Port Harcourt-Aba road leading to the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is in “public interest”.
DSP Nnamdi Omoni, spokesman of the Rivers Police Command appealed to the residents of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, to show understanding and cooperation.
According to Omoni, the closure was not intended to cause hardship for the residents.
The Waterlines Bus-stop to GRA stop axis of the road has remained closed since the March 9, 2019 governorship and house of assembly polls.
“It is in the interest of Rivers; it is not intended to cause hardship for the residents. The people should bear with the Command; it is only for a while,” he said, adding that the action was meant to "protect INEC office situated between Waterlines and GRA bus stops, its personnel and electoral materials in the office”.
Rivers Women To Turn Up At INEC Office Naked — Unless Effanga Is Removed As REC
The women threatened that if in the next 48 hours, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), fails to heed to their demand, they would storm INEC's Port Harcourt head office naked.
Thousands of women have taken to the streets of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, to demand the immediate redeployment of the Obo Effanga, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC).
The protesters, dressed in black and drawn from the 23 local government areas of the state, said his continued stay in the state was breeding tension and possible breakdown of law and order.
Carrying placards with various inscriptions, the women threatened that if in the next 48 hours, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), fails to heed to their demand, they would storm INEC's Port Harcourt head office naked.
Protests for and against the INEC REC have intensified in Rivers State in the last three days, with pro-government demonstrators asking that Effanga be retained in the state, whereas the anti-Effanga protesters want his removal, accusing him of compromising the outcome of the March 9 governorship and state house of assembly elections in the state to favour Nyesom Wike, incumbent Governor of Rivers State.
The women are not alone in the call for the removal of Effanga, as some governorship candidates have joined the call.
In a recent article he wrote and circulated, Tonye Cole, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said only the redeployment of Effanga would guarantee conducive atmosphere for free and fair elections in Rivers State.
He called for the outright cancellation of the polls, just as he re-echoed earlier calls by Dumo Lulu-Briggs, the Accord Party candidate, who had described the entire exercise as a "charade", and Victor Fingesi of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), who said INEC planned the polls to fail.
Ruiz Asks Anthony Joshua For Third Fight After Nigerian Reclaims Heavyweight Titles
It was a masterful performance from AJ in Saudi Arabia; the Nigerian-born British boxer schooled Ruiz from range and never allowed the Mexican-American to close the gap.
Anthony Joshua on Saturday night comprehensively defeated Andy Ruiz Jr 118-110, 118-110, 119-109 in their rematch to regain his IBF, IBO, WBO and WBA (super) heavyweight titles.
It was a masterful performance from AJ in Saudi Arabia; the Nigerian-born British boxer schooled Ruiz from range and never allowed the Mexican-American to close the gap.
Joshua jabbed Ruiz Jr to death and he never gave the champion a chance to get inside and land the nasty hooks that led to AJ’s demise the first time around.
After the fight, both men showed their respect for one another and embraced before they did their post-fight interviews, according to talksport.com
When Joshua asked Ruiz if he wanted to retire following calls for AJ to do the same after he lost in New York, Ruiz answered that he wanted a third fight.
Grabbing the mic, he said, “I want the third fight.”
He then asked the crowd, “Who wants to see the third fight?”
In fact, Ruiz Jr asked the Saudi Arabia crowd several times if they would like to see a third fight between the two men and he seemed to want to do it in Saudi again, too.
Joshua suggested he was well up for it too, declaring, “If you’ve heard, we’re gonna do a third.”
Ruiz was outclassed on the night and he admits he went into the rematch too heavy, having tipped the scales at more than 20 stone on Friday.
He said, “It was his night. I didn’t prepare how I should have.
“I gained too much weight. I don’t want to give excuses, he won. He boxed me around.
“If we do a third fight, I’m going to get in shape. I’ll be in the best shape of my life.
“I thought I was going to feel stronger. Next fight I’m going to get more prepared. I tried to train myself for this.
“I was chasing him too much. I was hesitating too much.”
Russia Gets Four Year Ban From All Global Sporting Events Over Doping
It means the Russia will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
Russia has been handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
It means the Russia will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the BBC reports.
But athletes, who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal, will be able to compete under a neutral flag.
WADA's executive committee made the unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
It comes after Russia's Anti-Doping Agency was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019.
It had to hand over data to WADA as condition of its controversial reinstatement in 2018 after a three-year suspension for its vast state-sponsored doping scandal.
WADA president, Sir Craig Reedie, said the decision showed its "determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis".
He added, "For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of Rusada's reinstatement conditions demanded a robust response.
That is exactly what has been delivered.	 	 
Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial."
Sack DSS DG, Yusuf Bichi, Premium Times Tells Buhari In New Editorial
Evidently, Mr Bichi’s DSS has become a major threat to the norms and values of a democratic system.”	 	 
Premium Times, an independent news platform in Nigeria, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately fire Yusuf Bichi, head of the Department of State Services, over his role in his men's Invasion of the Federal High Court in Abuja last Friday to rearrest Omoyele Sowore.	 	 
DSS Spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, had initially denied the invasion despite evidence.	 	 
The service later backtracked when Bichi sent a delegation to apologise to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court over the incident.	 	 
In an editorial on Friday, Premium Times said, The frightening scale of impunity and arbitrary conduct under the presidency of General Muhammadu Buhari plumbed new depths on Friday, December 6 when armed operatives of the State Security Service (often called the Department of State Services – DSS), invaded Federal High Court No. 7 in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.
We are now at that point where it is being argued that never in the history of Nigeria, including during the colonial period and the dark days of military rule, has such brazen act of disrespect for the sanctity of our law courts and independence of the judiciary been perpetrated.	 	 
We are greatly concerned that the DSS under the leadership of Yusuf Bichi has repeatedly acted as if it is above the laws of the land. The serial violations of the fundamental human rights of the citizens by the security outfit since Mr Bichi assumed the reins of leadership and the disdain with which it has been treating the judicial arm of government through flagrant disobedience of court orders that seek to put a stop to such violations, have indeed become routine.
