Muhammadu Buhari
Buhari embarked on a working visit to London since last week
The Nigerian youth showcased their anger towards the statement made by the president, Muhammadu Buhari in Commonwealth meeting held at Westminister, London on Wednesday where he stated that Nigerian youths are lazy
Buhari said "60% of 180 million people are not up to 30 years, many of them have not gone to school, they are saying that Nigeria is an oil producing country without them doing anything, and be getting accommodation, health care and education without paying any money"
But that statement vexed the youths which they declared on social media
An actor and also an aspiring governor of Anambra state Yul Edochie, responded the president on twitter "we are not lazy"
Another person that called himself Mr Jack Robinson said that "as a Nigerian youth escaped sudden death when given birth to in the most terrible country of the world, where the minimum wage of a worker is 60 dollars ($60), feeds himself, gets light for himself, without health security, the wage to pay him is telling the world that he is lazy"
whereas Jackson Ude said that it is a shameful that President Buhari, who said that he could not employ the youths, told the Commonwealth that many of Nigerian youths are lazy
Kelly said that it is very bad that Buhari called the youths lazy people because as he has said, other countries know that Nigerian youths are hardworking

Adesina said that the president's speech was misunderstood, where he pointed that criminals carried the news in wrong way
He stated that President Buhari always praises the well doing Nigerians in various spheres and he continues in this because he knows that they are amidst Nigerians
In his words, President Buhari said "we have much numbered youths, our population is about 180 million and 60% of the population is below 30 years
many of them have not gone to school but they are saying that Nigeria is an oil producing country, this is why they will stay without doing anything and expecting things like; house, health and free education"

Igbo Taboos: five things that Igbo land forbids
Five things that can cause death in the olden days in Igbo land, for the land forbids it
This family killed
Till now, murder is an abomination in the entire Igbo land
In the olden days, the Igbos have many behaviours which attract death immediately someone commits them
Chiagozie Nnabuihe who is a professor of African studies in the University of Lagos, explained that it is the spirit underworld that forbids these abomination
who is the spirit of the land?
Tradition explained that the spirit of the land is a woman
do you know the god worshipped by the Igbos in the olden days?
can you do the kind of sacrifices of appeal done in the olden days
Aside Most-high God, land is the most important spirit in Igbo land
In the olden days, Igbo believes that land can trouble anyone that defiles it
it is this spirit that ensure the germination of seed in the farm, and also continous wetness of the ground
What are the five things the Igbos and Spirit of the land forbid?
murder
Anyone that commits murder will bear the consequences
The land forbids human blood
Nnabuihe explained that the Igbos believed that land is a life giver
That is why it becomes law that nobody kills another, for the person will not be able to give life
The punishment for anybody who commits murder is to banish the person from the land or send the person to the evil forest where he/she will die
to commit suicide
The land will reject who kills himself
Like murder, suicide is also what the land forbids because blood is involved
Nnabuihe explained that the land rejects the corpse of anyone that commits suicide
Before they take the person's corpse to the evil forest, the native doctors will offer many sacrifices to wipe out any disaster which it could bring to the people
it is after this ceremony that the youths will carry the person's corpse to the evil forest
sleeping with a member of your family
this is what the land forbids and also an abomination in Igbo land
If a child is born through this act, the villagers will carry him to the evil forest and banish the family of the child from the land
Igbo believes that land has cursed that family
sleeping with animals
This animal contacts disease
It is difficult to hear that someone commits such a thing in Igbo land
But whenever it happens, Igbo believes that the land will transmit disease to the person
This disease could be madness, leprosy, stomach upset or dropsy and other things
The people will hurriedly take the person to the evil forest where he will die
giving birth to twins
Christianity has made Igbos stopped many of these laws
This is heartbreaking  but the cause is not known
Igbo believes in the olden days that the land is a life giving spirit, also gives child, gives a couple only one baby at a time
The believe that any woman who give birth to twins, has a sexual affair with another man who is not her husband
What happens when a woman gives birth to twins is that both the woman and the children will be taken to the evil forest where they will die
