I think Minster Pantami’s hasty intervention is something we need to avert in our industry to avoid reversal of whatever progress we have made in the telecoms industry so far because regulating the telecoms industry is a delicate balancing of the Act,’’ Aluko noted.
From his perspective, the Administrative Secretary, Association of Licensed Telecoms Companies of Nigeria (ALTON), Gbolahan Awonuga, who had expressed worry over the Minister’s move, also amplified Aluko’s voice, saying, “The issue being discussed is not policy, but regulation which has a legal document backing it.
”.
“We are confusing regulation with policy.
There was a determination on this USSD, even before the appointment of the Minister,” he stated.
Gbolahan argued that the CBN is protective of the banks, but wondered why the telecom operators, who are even the owners of the USSD platforms, are being treated unfairly.
“It is not about the good boy, but this is commercial and the normal things have been done.
Operators did not come up overnight to charge N4.
It was robustly deliberated upon and a decision jointly taken before the legal instrument was published for implementation by all parties involved,” he explained further.
Similarly, the President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Olusola Teniola, vehemently queried where the autonomy of the NCC lies if the ministry continues to interfere.
Teniola stated that the Federal Government needed to allow the NCC’s independence to enforce decisions made, especially as it bothers on the development of the telecommunications industry.
Indeed, The Guardian checks showed that there is a legal basis for the NCC’s intervention to protect telecoms service consumers (i.e.bank customers who use USSD for financial transactions).
Earlier in his keynote address on ``Reforming the Maritime Sector in Onitsha; Priority Areas, Potential Projects and the Way Forward,’’ Mr Moghalu noted that transportation was indispensable in the World today.
The event was held at All Saints Cathedral, Onitsha.                                                                                        According to him, ongoing concessionary processes to address certain issues resolved that they will continue working to complete the port project.
Specifically, Section 4 of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003, wherein in Section 4 (1), the Commission is empowered to carry out such functions as: “facilitation of investments in and entry into the Nigerian market for provision and supply of communications services, equipment and facilities; the protection and promotion of the interests of consumers against unfair practices including but not limited to matters relating to tariffs and charges for and the availability and quality of communications services, equipment and facilities; ensuring that licensees implement and operate at all times the most efficient and accurate billing system.
Mr Moghalu said this while exchanging views with newsmen after a sensitisation seminar of South East zone stakeholders by NIWA.
NCC is also saddled with the responsibility of promoting fair competition in the communications industry and protection of services and facilities providers from misuse of market power or anti-competitive and unfair practices by other service or facilities providers or equipment suppliers; and the responsibility to general responsibility of the Commission for economic and technical regulation of the communications industry.
To many Nigerians, the use of USSD sounded new, but checks by The Guardian showed that the initiative has been in effect since 2014.
This initiative, however, got a boost this year, when the NCC did a determination report on it.
The report obtained from NCC’s website termed ‘Determination of USSD Pricing,’ dated July 23, 2019, and signed by the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof.
Umar Danbatta, revealed, among other things, that a USSD session is 20 seconds; the cost of a USSD session is N1.
63K; the price floor for a 20 seconds USSD service is N1.
63k while price cap for a 20 Seconds USSD Session is N4.
89k.
The Determination stated that telecom operators are to price at cost plus margin but stresses that the determination does not apply to the currently zero-rated USSD services such as customer service, balance inquiry, purchase of airtime and data services, among others related to telecommunications services.
The Determination document envisaged the implementation of the USSD charges by the mobile network operators (MNOs) to take effect from September 1, 2019, and remains valid and binding on licensees.
However, Whether the MTN took official permission before its announcement to its customers remains unclear, as telecoms licensees are obligated to always get official approval/permission of the regulator before going to market to introduce any new tariff or pricing regime to their subscribers.
The legal document also notes that “the Commission reserves the right to amend and review this Determination at any time, as well as to consider other options to incentivise the communications industry,” and not the ministry.
It further states that such a review may be necessitated by major change in the market conditions and/or the underlining principles of this Determination.
In the formulation of this Determination, it was gathered that the banks had applied to the NCC for USSD codes for their mobile transactions, where they were now directed to the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) independently.
Meanwhile, ALTON’s accounts of how the USSD usage by the banks began and the support of the Commission in allowing the banks to use the USSD platform to facilitate digital financial inclusion is also revealing in the document obtained by The Guardian.
According to ALTON, while telecommunication services and infrastructure became more accessible in the country, the banks identified the USSD channel as a cost-efficient way of delivering financial services to their customers.
“The banks subsequently applied for and were granted USSD shortcodes to deliver financial services to bank customers by the Nigerian Communications Commission (“the Commission”).
‘‘At the nascent stage of USSD development for the financial services sector, the billing mode adopted by our members was to charge the telecommunications service consumer directly, which is referred to as end-user billing.
Green House won the track events while White House won in football match.
However, “following complaints by its customers with regard to disappearing/illegal airtime deductions, ALTON said there was a consensus with the banks to implement corporate billing where the banks absorbed the costs associated with deploying the USSD platform for financial services.
Calisthenics and match past added glamour to the ceremony.
These are according to a letter obtained from the Ministry, which was dated October 28, 201 and addressed to the Minister Pantami and duly signed by ALTON Chairman and Executive Secretary, Gbenga Adebayo, and Kazeem Ladepo respectively.
Taking a swipe at the banks, ALTON said rather than open new banking locations and deploying more Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), the banks increasingly used the USSD platform to provide a bouquet of services not initially contemplated by its members, which included account balance enquiries, funds transfers, account opening for tier one customers and other services unique to each Banks portfolio of services.
The body also said the banks also used this channel to grow significant revenues running into billions of Naira in view of the large disparity between the cost charged by its members and the charge imposed by the banks on their customers.
For instance, data from the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) showed that between January and March 2019, USSD-based transactions conducted through mobile money by some 2.3 million customers averaged 41.1 million valued at N810 billion worth of transactions.
Onitsha, Feb. 25, 2020 (MOI) Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer  (CEO), National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Mr George Moghalu, says he will strive to make the Onitsha River Port functional during his tenure.
ONITSHA RIVER PORT‘LL BECOME FUNCTIONAL IN MY TENURE -- SAYS MD NIWA
This, alone, according to industry watchers, indicates the high volume of USSD-based transactions that are enabled monthly by the MNOs’ infrastructure.
ALTON noted that these new services continued to place a strain on its members’ network resources, which resulted in their continued and further investments to ensure that the SDCCH channel was dimensioned to handle the increased traffic as a result of the new banking services being deployed on it.
The telecoms body pointed out that services provided by the banks constitute a minimum of 90 per cent of the total traffic on the USSD channels of its members.
However, since the suspension of the USSD charges by the Ministers, no authority has stopped the banks from charging customers an amount ranging from N10- N50, according to ALTON and confirmation by sources within the banking industry.
“We are the landlords, that is, the owners of the infrastructure, we have been asked not to charge our tenants, who are the banks, yet the tenants continue to charge customers, even unfairly through their hidden and non-transparent billing, as bank customers hardly know how much they are being charged,” said Adebayo.
However, the Governor of CBN, Godwin Emefiele and the Body of Banks’ CEOs (BOBCEOs) have since denied their being party to the Determination, contrary to the evidence obtained by The Guardian the determination document while the CBN has patted the banks on the back to maintain the status quo.
Stakeholders have, therefore, called for immediate industry stakeholder forum to resolve the lingering issue in to ensure appropriate billing in line with legal document developed by the NCC with a view to accelerating financial digital inclusion in to prevent growth reversal in the country’s digital inclusion drive.
New images have surfaced of what really happened during the September pressure testing of Boeing’s new 777X aircraft.
September’s pressure test was widely reported to have failed, with a cargo door being blamed for the issue.
Now, it seems that the situation was a lot more serious than that.
According to reports, it wasn’t just the door that ruptured, but the entire fuselage!.
Earlier reports that a cargo door blew out are not entirely unfounded.
Apparently the fuselage skin ripped open just behind the wing, and as such a passenger door was dislodged and fell to the factory floor.
The damage is clearly far worse than originally revealed; the test aircraft is a complete write-off.
Of the incident, Boeing spokesperson, Paul Bergmanm, explained that in the final load testing of the 777X static test airplane, the team conducted a test that involves bending the wings of the airplane up to a level far beyond anything expected in commercial service.
“A testing issue occurred during the final minutes of the test, at approximately 99 per cent of the final test loads, and involved a depressurisation of the aft fuselage.
The test team followed all safety protocols.
“As we shared on our October 23 earnings call, our root cause assessment continues, and we are pleased with the progress we are making as we complete our detailed analysis.
What we’ve seen to date reinforces our prior assessment that this will not have a significant impact on the design or our preparations for first flight.
We do not see any impact from the test on the overall program schedule.
“On the call, we did update our target for first delivery from late 2020 to early 2021.
As we’d said for some time, there had been significant risk to the late 2020 timeline.
What changed is that we now have a clearer understanding of how the GE9X engine issue has impacted the details of our flight test program.
For example, the timing of engines for the remaining flight test airplanes will affect when they begin flying, which in turn affects our detailed test schedules.
When we account for all these factors, we expect to fly in early 2020 deliver in 2021.

Saturday 21st of May 2016, The Great Hall, Kensington, London, hosted Africa’s largest awards ceremony for Women in Europe and the Commonwealth.
In its fifth year Women4Africa is steadily growing its vision of elevating the ordinary African woman doing extraordinary things.
The Special guest of honour and Special Woman award recipient was Mrs Aisha Buhari.
She was ably represented by an official delegation of three governors’ wives led by Mrs Florence Ajimobi wife of the Oyo state governor, accompanied by the Wife of the governor of Ebonyi State Mrs Umahi and Zamfara state Mrs Yari.
Also in attendance was The Senior Special Advisor to the President on foreign and diaspora affairs.
Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa.
Founders of Women4Africa Sam and Tola Onigbanjo were delighted at the kind gesture of Mrs Buhari and in response to her official statement read vowed to keep on elevating “The continent of Africa and its amazing Women”.
While speaking about homeland security, George “Gaffe” Bush once said, “I just want you to know that, when we talk about war, we’re really talking about peace.
``Sports and culture elongates life; nurture health and one can earn a living from it too.’’
Well, in contrast, I just want you to know that when we talk about gender, we’re really talking about gender.
Which is to say, we are not just talking about women.
Most people wrongly associate gender issues with women’s issues.
I recall doing a degree in Gender Studies and when people asked what I was studying and I replied gender, they would nevertheless proceed to ask, “So, what is women’s studies about?”.
It was baffling.
In actual fact I was not interested in women’s studies alone or I would have chosen that course.
Instead, I chose to study gender because I am interested in masculinity and femininity, in gender norms attributed to the male and female sexes, in the interaction – the never-ending conflicts and also the opportunities to live together harmoniously – caused by gender roles.
What are those roles? The answer depends on many things, including the particular environment that you find yourself in.
In a country like Nigeria, gender roles not only vary from region to region but they’re also shaped by our tetchy colonial past, and the education and religion that came with that predicament.
Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world where, for example, women have reigned not only as queens but as kings.
In fact, female kings such as Ahebi Ugbabe who ruled Igala in Igboland in the twentieth century are arguably a precursor to transgender (people who express their gender outside of the norm) discussions today.
However, Nigeria is also a country where, to give another example, if you are male you can pass your nationality to a non-Nigerian female through marriage.
If on the other hand you are a Nigerian female, by all means set your eyes on a non-Nigerian husband, but our legislation will always consider your marriage as one to a foreigner.
If you are female, gender roles such as housewife, the weaker sex, the shrinking violet, the bimbo etc.
may be used to describe you.
If you are male, the roles of provider, macho man, gentleman or rational thinker may be attributed to you.
Furthermore, although gender norms are limiting for both sexes (e.
g.
men should never be vulnerable and women should never be bossy yada yada yada) since most powerful traits are seen to be masculine, if you are a woman there is perhaps even more of an incentive to define womanhood for yourself.
So why is all of this political? After all the column is “Gender Politics”.
Well, for three primary reasons.
Firstly, precisely because gender and power are closely linked.
Secondly, because maleness and power are also closely linked.
And thirdly, because the first two points cause problems.
You may like to read the column regularly.
Not because the author is claiming, like any good salesperson, that it will gain you great relationships, a happy life, prosperity and mind-blowing sex.
In all honesty, I doubt reading this column will bring you any closer to that.
(And if against the odds it does, please at least buy me dinner.
Chairman of the Occasion, Dr Stanislaus Igbokwe said that without sports and culture, a nation was not complete.
But my column may give you a greater understanding of how gender norms shape our realities.
It may cause you to marvel, as I do, at the social, sexual and cultural roles between genders and how those relate to our inner sense of power as well as to political structures.
And that in return may have a positive effect.
At the very least, we can quarrel about all things gender-related and that’s always a blast (or not).
One more thing for now.
If you thought that there are only two genders you are mistaken.
There are numerous, seventy-one (at least) according to the pre-populated list that Facebook users can choose from when choosing a gender identity.
That said, the main focus in my column is gender politics as it relates to women and men.
ANAMBRA GOVERNMENT, I HAIL YOU ON SECURITY By Regina Igwebuike
``Sports and culture elongates life; nurture health and one can earn a living from it too.’’
Chairman of the Occasion, Dr Stanislaus Igbokwe said that without sports and culture, a nation was not complete.
Patron of Green House, which took overall 1st position in the field/track events, Mr Paul Okpala Akuluono pleaded with state government to harness sports talents from school children.
Another House patron, Prince Augustine Udoh said that work and play make for balanced growth of a child, stressing that parents should not relinquish children’s training to teachers. You should start fighting vices from home.
``We solicit for sponsors’ support in facilitating acquisition of sporting playgrounds. Also, the nature of our terrain has led us to pave the school compound with inter-locking stones,’’ Adawai said.
Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor, Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese has praises Anambra State Government for using its security apparatus to track two Awka Diocesan priests kidnapped last year in Ondo State.
The prelate noted that Gov. Obiano used the state’s security apparatus to track down, the kidnapped priests.
``Children are our future. Anambra State should invest in school sports. I appeal to government to construct Attah road, linking Nkpor-Umuoji road across St. Edmund to Nkpor Old road,’’ Akuluono said.
The bishop decried incessant and barbaric killings of innocent Nigerian’s especially Christians.
Ezeokafor made the commendation at Ukpo, Dunukofia Local Government Area on Feb. 6, during burial of mother of Bishop of Mrs Rebecca Amatu.
``Academic excellence, moral probity and physical fitness are our watchwords. Here, we preach against cultism and our security men are always on alert. Anyone caught over cultism will face the law.
He thanked Gov. Willie Obiano for his giant strides in the area of security, urging him to sustain the tempo.
In a welcome address, School Manager, Rev. Fr. Michael Adawai said they applied holistic approach to children’s educational development, noting that they had zero tolerance for cultism.
Ezeokafor, however, also expressed shock at gruesome murder of Lawan Andimi, Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, Michika LGA Adamawa State by terrorists.
He said any government that did not value the sacredness of life was a failure.
He stressed that government at the centre should provide the enabling environment for security of life and property.
According to him, Government at the centre must encourage local policing to secure lives of the people, who elected them into office.
``Any government that cannot do the needful to secure life and property of its citizens should surrender; use whatever God endowed you with to work toward eternal life.
``Academic excellence, moral probity and physical fitness are our watchwords. Here, we preach against cultism and our security men are always on alert. Anyone caught over cultism will face the law.
BISHOP AMATU BURIES 96-YEAR-OLD MUM By Regina Igwebuike : https://www.
In a welcome address, School Manager, Rev. Fr. Michael Adawai said they applied holistic approach to children’s educational development, noting that they had zero tolerance for cultism.
She thanked management of St. Edmund Group of schools for going extra the mile to borrow St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, Nkpor sporting ground to accommodate all sporting events.
Lady Lizzy Ewuzie, Area Education Officer (AEO), Idemili North represented the commissioner at the event.
According to the commissioner said sports help in mental, physical and psychological development of learners, stressing that properly engaging youths in sports will make them lose interest in social vices.
7, 2020 (MOI) Catholic Bishop of Okigwe Diocese, Imo State, Most Rev. Solomon Amatu accompanied by family and friends, bid farewell to his late mother, Mrs Rebecca Mgboye Amatu aged 96.
Prof. Omenugha made the call during Inter-house sports competition organised by St. Edmund Group of Schools, Nkpor.
The deceased was born on Feb. 14, 1923 into family of late Pa/Mrs Anakonwa of Oranto Village, married to late Pius Amatu of Obinagu Akpu Village, both in Ukpo.
SCHOOLS URGED TO PROMOTE SPORTS, CURB CULTISM AS ST EDMUND SCHOOLS NKPOR HOLD INTER-HOUSE SPORTS
Speaking while concelebrating the burial Mass at St. Simon Catholic Church, Ukpo, Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor, Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese said that burying the dead was one of the ``corporal works of mercy’’.
Nkpor (Idemili North LGA), Feb. 25, 2020 (MOI) Anambra State Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof. Kate Omenugha has urged private and public schools to promote sports as panacea against cultism and other vices among youths.
Mr Emmanuel Nwafor, member representing Orumba South Constituency suggested proper checking of the seals of the consultants in other to ascertain their level of authenticity because fake seals abound.
Ezeokafor added that the deceased lived her life in the hope of resurrection, which was a fulfillment of what we believe in as Christians.
He emphasised that death was an answered prayer as one transcended from temporal life to eternity to live at peace with God.
The prelate noted that Mrs Amatu was energetic, beautiful as well as a good singer with a golden voice.
``She was a notable lead singer in all ceremonies and activities in her town and beyond, which merited her name `Onu Ogene’.
He explains: ``life is a gift from God, which must be respected’’, urging those who fail to take care of their parents at old age to retrace their steps so as to reap God’s promise of long life’’.
One of the deceased sons, Most Rev.
Solomon Amatu said that his mother was non believer and became a Christian convert in 1962 to Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) as a result of miraculous healing of her husband when he was down, bedridden after attending a crusade.
Bishop Amatu noted that she was an ardent and devout member of CAC until 2003, when she became a Catholic faith after his Episcopal Ordination.
According to him, she embraced the conversion and convincingly remained ardent and devoted to it until her last breath, praying God for a repose of her soul.
Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, who attended the event, commiserated with Amatu family, praying God to grant them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
Gov.
Obiano thanked those, who came to pray for the deceased’s soul, especially those who came from far places, praying God to grant them journey mercies.
He noted that the state was enjoying security to the glory of God.
Delivering a tribute at the grave side, Dr Solomon Anigbankpu, on behalf of the deceased’s grand/great grandchildren said that grandma knew precisely what good education could do to anyone, who persisted to the end.
``She believes that it is better to develop common sense first before western education to avoid behaving and acting like a child.
``She lived a life of prayer, selfless service, high sense of responsibility and charity, humility, hard work, tenacity and doggedness.
``Her prayer life is infectious and you can never stay with her without being infected,’’ he emphasised.
Dignitaries at the ceremony include Archbishop Valerian Okeke of Onitsha Archdiocese, Owerri Provincial Bishops, a former Governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi.
A former INEC Chairman, Prof.
Maurice Iwu, Anambra Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Ndidi Mezue, Traditional Rulers and people from all walks of life attended too.

HOS WELFARE ASSOCIATION CONDUCTS FREE HEALTH SCREENING AMIDST END OF YEAR CELEBRATION
By MaryAnn Chukwuma/Amaka Isikala :
Awka, Dec. 6, 2019 (MOI) As part of Christmas largesse, Welfare Association of the Office of the Head of Service (HOS), organised free health screening for staff members to mark the end of the year celebration.
The event took place at the HOS Conference Hall, Jerome Udoji Secretariat Complex, Awka.
Barr Harry Udu, Anambra Head of Service noted that end of year celebration did not mean end to duties but meant to reawaken everyone to their duties.
He urged workers to always follow the clear principles of dedication to service of the state and humanity as shown by Gov. Willie Obiano.
The civil service boss hailed efforts of dedicated workers in service, encouraging them to continue in displaying goodness.
He called on retiring staff members, who were sent forth to transit their experience into the wider society as they have become senior citizens.
Chairman of the Association and Acting Director, Administration Department, HOS, Mr Prince Nwude, JP, thanked God for His continued protection and support toward workers.
Mr Nwude urged the workers to maintain good working relationship with one another as it was the prerequisite for effective service delivery.
He enjoined them to eschew bitterness and rancour in order to maintain high productivity in their various offices.

TECHNOLOGY, KEY TO CURBING EXAM MALPRACTICE SAYS BASIC EDUCATION COMMISSIONER
By Chinazo Okoye/Obianuju Azukaego/Nnaemeka Egwuonwu :
Awka, Dec. 6, 2019 (MOI) Anambra State Basic Education Commissioner, Prof. Kate Omenugha says technology is necessary in curbing menace of examination malpractice in the education sector.
Prof. Omenugha said this when members of National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, (NAPPS) paid her a courtesy visit in her office at Jerome Udoji Secretariat, Awka.
The commissioner, who noted that government had zero tolerance to exam malpractice, added that 275 laptops had been acquired to that effect.
She enjoined the NAPPS members to support government in its effort to reduce exam misconduct in the state.
``Government cannot curb the menace alone, so we have to join hands to win this war against exam malpractice.
``This is why we said that all private schools must undergo re-accreditation assessment to ensure they meet the standard necessary for the registration of students for exams such as WAEC.’’
Omenugha noted that schools would be required to install IP cameras in their exam halls and construct flat tables without drawers for the re-accreditation exercise.
According to her, the idea is aimed at discouraging exam malpractices among students and teachers.
``While the IP cameras capture everything that transpires in the exam halls, the flat tables without drawers discourage students from bringing extraneous materials into the hall,’’ Omenugha said.
Prof. Omenugha added that the use of school register to register students for exams had been replaced with biometric capturing of the students.
Anambra State Chairman NAPPS, Mrs Amaka Ezedebego, commended the commissioner for her effort in the fight against exam malpractice.
Mrs Ezedebego said they were not against government's decision to re-accredit schools, but pleaded that enough time should be given to them to meet with the requirements as they were capital intensive
Another NAPPS member, Mrs Chinwe Orikaeze, thanked government for the initiative, noting that it would help to check exam malpractice.
Mrs Orikaeze appealed to government to carry out the re-accreditation exercise in those schools that had not been re-accredited by WAEC and NECO. (MOI)

UNICEF, ANAMBRA GOVERNMENT ENSURE CONTINUOUS EDUCATION OF WOMEN ON ESSENTIAL FAMILY PRACTICES
By Regina Igwebuike :
Nise (Awka South LGA), Dec. 5, 2019 (MOI) Five Community-based Organisations (CBOs) in Anambra State, Ezira, Nnewi, Neni, Obosi and Nise have also benefitted from UNICEF Speaking Sessions aimed at creating awareness on Essential Family Practices (EFPs).
The EFPs include breastfeeding of infant exclusively for about six months, taking into account WHO/UNICEF/UNIDS policies and recommendation on HIV and infant feeding; taking children for full course of immunisation before their first birthday.
It entails recognising when sick children need treatment outside the home and take them for healthcare to the appropriate provider.
It also includes disposal of faeces including children’s faeces safely; washing hands with soap after defecation, before preparing meals and feeding children.
The EFPs also include; ensuring that every pregnant woman receives the recommended minimum of four antenatal visits, recommended doses of tetanus toxide vaccination.
These EFPs are supported by family and community in seeking appropriate care, especially at the time of delivery and during the postpartum breastfeeding period.
In a speech during the sessions, Mrs Chineze George-Ileka, UNICEF Desk Officer, Anambra Ministry of Information and Public Enlightenment, Awka said that UNICEF was concerned about reducing mother and child mortality and morbidity rates.
Mrs George-Ileka noted that women and children were agents of change; the training to enable them to change the narrative of failure to that of breath-taking success in their communities.
She emphasised that personal, family and community cleanliness would promote good health that was essential for growth and development.
The desk officer noted that people were always in a hurry to eat whatever would come their ways without properly washing their hands.
``Most illnesses and deaths are caused by germs that get into the mouth through food, unsafe water and dirty hands.’’
She demonstrated how to wash the mouth properly using chewing stick/tooth brush to avoid mouth odour, urging them to drink water always to reduce the acidic content of the stomach.
Mrs George-Ileka while saying that unhealthy practices constitute 90 per cent health challenges in the world, advocated for proper hygiene practices as a prerequisite to healthy living.
The Desk Officer, then, urged the women to put in their best to achieve behavioural change in lives of their community members so as to actualise UNICEF’s dream.
Dr Rose Amasiani, Anambra State Hygiene Promotion Officer decried the attitude of those who defecate on open surfaces and dump refuse indiscriminately, which constitute health hazards.
Dr Amasiani said that toilet was the safest place to throw away faeces to avoid the spread of disease.
She urged all families to have good pit toilet, pour-flush or water system in their homes.
The hygiene promoter noted that there were five faecoral routes of disease transmission to include food, fluid, field, finger and fruit.
She called for thorough washing of hands using soap or ash under running water as necessary after contact with faeces such as after using the toilet, cleaning up babies’ buttocks before feeding children.
She demonstrated how best to wash hands using soap and running water, advising them to air-dry their hands after washing as the use of general hand towel could be contagious.
On sanitary cleanliness, Dr Amasiani emphasised that hygiene was necessary during menses.
``Clean and dry sanitary pads/cloth should be available for girls and women. Sanitary pads should be disposed of properly with other refuse or buried.
``Where clothes are used during menses, wash them regularly with soap and clean water and dry them fully in the sun before the next use.
She adds: ``poor menstrual hygiene can lead to infections and repeated infections of the birth canal can cause failure to conceive’’.
The Motivational Speaker of the programme, Mrs Scholastica Okoli said that every woman had rights to healthcare, especially during pregnancy and childbirth.
``A pregnant woman needs to be checked by skilled birth attendants because something may go wrong.’’
Mrs Okoli said that exclusive breastfeeding was the only food and drink that an infant would need until the age of six months after which different kinds of food would be introduced.
``Make sure that the baby sucks the first yellowish milk (colostrums) that comes out of the breast, which helps to fight germs responsible for diseases.
``Breastfeeding helps to protect babies and young children against dangerous illness, creating special closeness between mother and child and prevents unplanned pregnancy.’’
On immunisation, she said that vaccination was urgent and compulsory as it helped the child to fight against major killer diseases.
``It is important that children get needed vaccines at the right time for full protection.
``A child who is not vaccinated is more likely to become sick, permanently disabled or become malnourished and dies.
``Proper breastfeeding helps in family planning; it helps woman to regain all that she lost during last pregnancy and child birth.’’
Mrs Okoli enjoined all pregnant women to attend antenatal clinic and access HIV screening and counseling to know whether they were already infected with it or not.
``If a pregnant woman is HIV positive, she should start HIV treatment immediately as provided by health workers.’’
Women leaders of the communities visited, ensured impressive turn-out of their members, mobilising the right calibre of people required for the training.
They promised to take ownership of the programme by ensuring proper and adequate supervision of the goings-on in their respective communities as ambassadors of change.
Lecture materials on basic health information on maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) as well as Information, Communication & Education( IEC) materials (facts for life) were handed over to leaders of communities visited. (MOI)

Experts want critical thinkers to lead, transform Nigeria
Stakeholders who converged on the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (NAU) Awka, Anambra State have canvassed the emergence of critical thinkers in leadership positions with a view to transforming Nigeria.
They stated this during the Ninth World Philosophy Day of the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) at the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Arts, with the theme, “Critical Thinking, Leadership and Social Transformation.”
A former Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Rev. Fr. Professor Obi Oguejiofor noted that leaders are drawn to the led if they possess critical thinking, analytical, communicative, creative, open-minded and problem solving to lead and transform organisations or institutions socially and economically.
He lamented that the problems dogging Nigeria and Africa’s developmental path stem from absence of leaders who could think critically from time to time, likening the failure of Nigerians to think critically in the clamour for power shift, which he said, does not produce the best leader who could give justice.
Also, former Chair, Department of English and Speech, A & T State University, North Carolina, United States of America, Professor Chimalu Nwankwo lamented that Africans do not think critically hence their inability to think on their own, but rely on dictates of foreigners.
Another stakeholder, Professor A.U. Igwe wondered if Nigerians apply critical thinking in whatever they do just as he condemned leaders who choose to become egocentric rather than critical thinkers when occupy leadership positions,
Igwe, who is a Professor of History, at NAU, said there were few African leaders who were guided by critical thinking, particularly the former President of Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara who he described as an ideal leader who employed critical thinking and rational application of force during his regime.
He observed that the UNESCO knows the important role philosophy plays in leadership; hence the declaration of November 21 every year as World Philosophy Day, stressing that critical thinking propels leaders to better the lot of their people.
On his part, Dr. Emmanuel Umezinwa of the Department of Music and the first Master Degree Graduate of Philosophy Department, said western system of thinking has inadvertently made Africans to sharpen their intellect and give too much thought to thinking, adding that there is an “overblown idea of thought.”
Govt. should enforce ban on religious activities in stadia ― Rojenny Proprietor
Rommy Ezeonwuka, Proprietor of Rojenny Stadium and Tourists Village, has called on government at all levels to ban religious and other non-sporting activities in all spots sports stadia in the country. Ezeonwuka made the call when he received members of Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Anambra chapter, who were on tour of sports facilities in the state.
The tour of sports was part of the three day SWAN Week activities in the state.
The facility investor blamed the collapse of most Nigerian stadia on their use for non-sporting activities like religious crusades and political rallies.
He berated successive sports administrators in the country for misuse of the multi-billion Naira facilities for momentary gain.

Ezeonwuka said Rojenny was still relevant more than three decades because he refused to allow such distractions in his facility.
“One major factor that is killing our sports facility is the permission to use them for activities that are not sports related, it is sad that government allows crusade, political rallies, burials in our stadia.
“Look at the National Stadium in Surulere, National Stadium Abuja and other facilities that should be used for training our youths for world championships collapsing because our administrators rent them out for money.
“Even here in Anambra, Achebe Stadium, Fegge and Ikpeazu Stadium have collapsed because of these things, it should be stopped and government should outlaw it.
“Sports has a spirit and you must respect the spirit of sports, that is why I have refused to allow anybody to use here for any other thing other than sports, that is the secret of Rojenny survival after 35 years.
“This is the only individually-owned Olympic size Stadium where you can hold most major games without leaving the stadium complex,” he said.
Ezeonwuka said Nigeria had all it takes to dominate sports at the world stage but regretted that administrators have reduced the country to mere training ground where other countries come to adopt talented athletes.
He said Nigeria must try to retain their best so that the country could enjoy the benefits of sporting economy like Europe, America and now, Asia.
On the coming Nigeria Police Games scheduled to hold at Rojenny next year, Ezeonwuka described Rojenny as the proverbial parish waiting for the priest to come and conduct the Holy Mass.
“Bahrain adopted about 10 Nigerians athletes, the young girls that recently won the world championship for them trained here, we must stop the West from poaching on us by placing value on what we have.
“Rojenny is like a parish waiting for the priest, the priest is the government who is supposed to create programmes so that athletes can make use of what we have here.
“It is not easy to run a stadium, even the government is finding it difficult, so those of us in the private sector need encouragement.
“I want to thank the Nigerian Police for finding here worthy and we promise that the 2020 Games will be the best for them,” he said.
In his remark, Philip Balepo, a veteran journalist, said Rojenny deserved a golden place in the history of Nigerian sports because of what he had done for the Nigerian youth.
Balepo, who expressed satisfaction with the ambience of Rojenny environment, called on Nigerian sports administrators to visit the place and see how best it could be optimised for sports growth.
The SWAN team was led by its chairman Anthony Oji.

Nigerians Marry Late Because It's Difficult For Them To Find The Right Partners, Says Expert
“The act of searching for a partner with the right genotype and looking for a financially capable partner are creating problems for singles in selecting a partner and often times eliminating the feeling of love."
Mope Ogunlusi, a relationship expert and marriage counsellor, has said Nigerians marry late because finding the right partner is usually difficult for them.
Ogunlusi, who has been a counsellor and matchmaker for 15 years, disclosed this on Saturday in Osogbo in an interview with NAN.
She also attributed late marriages to issues of genotype compatibility, financial status and parental influence on who a child should marry.
She said: “A lot of Nigerians are still single and unmarried despite reaching the marriageable age bracket because they often times find it difficult to find the right partners.
“The act of searching for a partner with the right genotype and looking for a financially capable partner are creating problems for singles in selecting a partner and often times eliminating the feeling of love.
“Sometimes, people fall in love just to find out that their genotypes are not compatible and this often times lead to searching all over for a new partner, often times leading to frustration if the same incompatibility keeps re-occurring.”
According to Ogunlusi, a lot of Nigerian singles now have little or no time to socialise and search for a life partner because of the financial pressure they face on daily basis.
“The need for financial security and meeting daily needs has created a routine life style for a lot of people and finding time to socialise has become difficult because of the time invested in searching for daily needs," she said.
In addition to the financial security challenges individuals face, she said some ladies and men are too choosy in selecting their partners based on his or her financial position and status.
She said the trend of looking for rich men or ladies to marry is creating a corrupt cycle that has affected marriage as a sacred institution ordained by God.
She added that some parents set standards for their children on who to marry, which adds to the problem.
Some parents usually set specification of the kind of man or woman their children can marry in terms of looks, tribe, ethnicity, educational qualification and finance, she said, commending, however, the efforts of matchmaking outfits in trying to help eliminate these problems created by social ills and nature, by creating a platform for singles to meet and have their dream marriages come true.

North Vs South Korea: World's Strangest Football Derby Holds Today
It's not too rare for the two sides to face off – but it's almost unheard of to play in the North's capital, Pyongyang. In fact, it has only happened once, in 1990.

On Tuesday, North and South Korea will play a football derby like no other, the BBC reports.
It's not too rare for the two sides to face off – but it's almost unheard of to play in the North's capital, Pyongyang. In fact, it has only happened once, in 1990.
There will be no live broadcast, no fans from the South, and no foreign media at all in the stands.
After some progress in 2018 - when sports partly broke the ice - ties between North and South are at a low.
Safe to say, this is a match the home side will not be taking lightly.
Football is the most popular spectator sport in North Korea and sports are hugely important for the North, Andray Abrahamian, Senior Adjunct Fellow at the Pacific Forum, told the BBC.
It provides a focal point for pride and patriotism. In a sense, it's pretty similar to how other countries use sports for social purposes.
Kick-off between the two men's national teams will be in the early evening (08:30 GMT), but if you want to follow the match, you'll have a hard time.
Apart from the fact it isn't being broadcast live, even international tourists currently in North Korea won't be allowed to watch the game.

Around 100 fake professors have been unearthed by the National Universities Commission in Nigeria, according to the Executive Secretary of the commission, Prof Abubakar Rasheed.
Rasheed said that details of the fake professors had been posted on the NUC website and the commission had to send the names to the various universities for verification.
This was contained in a recent bulletin of NUC, a report by Daily Sun said.
The NUC boss disclosed that the updated version of those documents would be published by December 2019 and that professors in their respective universities were made to upload their resume on the website which was used in the compilation of the directory and helped identify fake ones in the system.
He encouraged vice chancellors to have accurate statistics of staff, students and other components in their respective universities.
Rasheed stressed that the fight against fake professors was a collective responsibility, adding that lecturers were no longer permitted to teach in more than two universities, while minimum teaching of eight hours should be enforced.
Omoyele Sowore's Abduction And Implications Of Doing Business In Nigeria By Ayo Moses Ogedengbe
The very first item on the list touches directly on the gross injustices against Omoyele Sowore and his supporters and clearly sends a sharp message of disregard for the rule of law and the issue of personal and property tights.
There are too many civilised "nonentities" in Nigeria that think that they are trendy and classy just because they don't comment on national developments.
