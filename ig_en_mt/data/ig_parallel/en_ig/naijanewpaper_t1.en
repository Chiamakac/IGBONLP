But who really are they? Simply, technology.
Kano is centre of commerce, but if Kano does not become centre of e-commerce, it will disappear because technology is the future.
Everything is electronic now, even in Nigeria right now, any company that is not leveraging on technology will die.
If Shoprite does not evolve to online sales, Jumia will kill them and that’s the truth.
So, that’s the future, there is nothing you can do about it.
How does your New Partner Programme works?.
It is very simple, normally if I refer you to a broker, there is what we call spread, which is the difference between buying and selling price.
That is where brokers make their money.
They share about 50 per cent of that trading initially and we call them partners.
What if I refer you and you now become a partner and you refer somebody else and that person becomes a partner, who also referred someone? Shouldn’t you be making money in referring somebody? That is the new system that we have created, like higher level of stream of income for a partner, making it a multi-layer, instead of just a single layer system.
How reliable is the technology behind this business plan?.
Technology is not new.
At least, I have been in the business between seven and eight years and it has been around that same time.
I don’t think there has ever been any day that the whole market is down and nothing is working.
That has never happened.
For example, about 60 per cent of the whole American economy is in New York Stock Exchange, which is why companies like Ali Baba in China can leave the country to raise money in America because there’s no other place you can get that kind of money.
The whole American economy is built on the New York Stock Exchange, which is the same trading we are talking about.
If it is not reliable, they won’t put all their lives in it.
When people tell me that the likes of “Wonder Banks” and MMM had gone under, wondering if the forex market will not go like them, I only tell them that they are looking at it locally.
Forex market is not a Nigerian thing, it’s not an American thing, it is not a Japanese thing, it is the whole world and driven by a level of fundamentals.
So, it can go down unless human beings are all going down.
What competitive advantage is Rally Trade coming with?.
To be frank, all brokers offer the same thing.
It’s like all Nigerian stockbrokers offer the same thing.
You want to buy First Bank or GTBank shares, they are all offering the same thing.
But the things that can make you different are in-depth customer service, things that sometimes, as a stockbroker, you take more time to research on.
Of course, you can advise your clients on how to buy shares.
But if people can see that your clients are making more money, it becomes extra advantage.
In Rally Trade for instance, we have unusual customer support.
Our staff call clients every day to know if there is any problem or challenge.
Every client has a dedicated staff that takes care of his or her business.
Then we have the best education system here.
There is no company that is educating Nigerians like Rally academy does.
In terms of our conferences, expos, seminars and the trainings we do in our office frequently.
So, those are some of the two major advantages that we have- essential customer service and quality education system.
There is this fear about Fintech, especially that of trust.
What is your take?.
All a company can do is to make sure that it is dealing with a regulated institution, the same way we are sure that banks are regulated by Central Bank of Nigeria.
We are regulated in Europe by financial commission.
At the same time, when I talk to people about online business, if you decide to run away and hide yourself in the sand, saying you don’t trust it, your money might disappear, you will never do anything.
You won’t believe that some people don’t use ATM till today, you know why, saying if they are being caught up in a corner, all their money will be collected.
Some people don’t use Internet banking but that doesn’t help you at all.
You are losing more than you are gaining.
That is the way it is.
With the current technology comes challenges and hacking of funds, but yet, there is nothing you can do about it other than find how to use them safely and make sure you do enough research.
Wherever you are putting your money, do extensive research.
For instance, in the last 10 years, Nigerians have gone through several scams.
We had MMM, Wonder Banks, among others, but I have never lost one kobo to any of them because I learnt about 10 years ago that there are no free money and I had been a victim online, when I lost like $200 and had to withdraw.
So, when Wonder Bank and MMM came, I knew that it was just scam.
People need to be educated, do research, then you really have very little issues when it comes to doing financial business online.
What is the MT4 Platform all about?.
Let me try to describe the MT4 in a simple way.
Let’s use car, which is the best way.
A Toyota and a Honda, what is the difference? Nothing! They both are cars.
But in Nigeria, we have more Toyota than Honda, why? People just love Toyota! Or maybe Toyota is easier to maintain or it has more second hand value or it is cheaper to buy.
The same way we have different trading platforms.
For instance, there is a company called Tesla, which makes car in the U.S.
He added that immense opportunities abound in the sector that had remained largely untapped. ``This is why most advanced economies of the world have highly developed their maritime industries’’.
They didn’t exist before now.
The same way companies create trading platforms for themselves.
So, I can start a brokerage company and decide that like the software banks use, I don’t want to use a certain platform, but a fresh one people can trade on that can be better, but that doesn’t mean people are going to love it.
Tesla is in America now but doesn’t mean it is selling more than Toyota that has been selling for a while.
MT4 is just a platform people trade on, just to buy and sell, that is what it is but it is the oldest, it has the highest adoption, it is what people love the most, so every broker has it.
Quran used for muslim prayer.
It does not bother me at all that you woke up today and you are bothered by matters bothering your brethren, male and female.
It does not bother me at all that you are there seated or standing running after the necessities of life.
It bothers me a trifle that you are buffeted by the vicissitudes of life, by the vagaries and uncertainties of living and by the pursuit of that which would not last.
Quran used for muslim prayer.
Yes.
It is the will of the Almighty in creation that all subjects born of the womb shall toil and labour in order to enjoy and suffer.
The worshipper of the Merciful shall observe vigil at night in order to qualify for His favours.
The armed robber shall forsake the pleasure of his bed at night in order to visit pain on the neighbourhood and thereby qualify for punishment and eternal damnation.
Yes.
Those who shall enter paradise have to work and sweat; those who shall enter hell would have to earn it through toil and labour! I am not bothered by all of these simply because this is the reality.
I am concerned with one other thing, however.
I am concerned with the possibility that you are involved in the frenetic pursuit of this world on the assumption that you could indeed have it all.
No! You cannot have it all.
Nobody has ever had it all.
Nobody will ever have it all.
Evidence in support of these claims and assertions are there in your wakeful moments, in your everyday life.
There she is seated.
The pepper grinder in the neighbourhood.
Every time her husband copulates with her, pregnancy sets in.
Today, she is nursing two beautiful girls.
Only a year before, she gave birth to a boy.
Her husband is the Chief Messenger in that office.
Yes.
The Chief Messenger.
To every profession its chief.
There is the Chief Whip in the Parliament.
There are chiefs in the palace.
I wonder whether there are chiefs among thieves and kidnappers.
Yes.
There are Chief Lecturers.
But there are no Chief Professors.
Now the chief messenger of interest to me today is he whose spermatozoic prowess is reminiscent of the “Danfo” driver in the other part of the town.
The latter is loved and abhorred by women in the bus station by equal measure.
They know that whenever he ‘touches’ the opposite sex, often times illicitly, the latter would bear the ‘burden’ for the next nine months.
This Chief Danfo driver owns no vehicle.
He owns no properties.
He has no investment in any blue-chip companies.
He has no bank accounts.
He knows that he is poor.
He desires to be rich.
But at least for now, he is contented in the knowledge that he does not have it all.
He is contented that at least he has his virility and masculinity.
He is happy in the knowledge that he is an active partaker in the unceasing task of populating the world!.
Across the town, in an area known as GRA, there lives the multi-millionaire.
He has almost everything money can buy- a posh house and state-of-the-art automobiles.
His wife is that woman who is subject of the second gaze whenever she steps out of her home: beautiful, elegant and intelligent.
However, despite these provisions and blessings, the woman is not happy.
She cries every night because she has not been blessed with the fruit of the womb.
Whenever she contemplates the plum and pleasure that surrounds her, she remembers what material comfort cannot provide.
She shed hot tears for being barren.
She has it; but she cannot have it all.
Meanwhile, one of the children of the poor ‘Danfo’ driver is registered in one of the public schools in the neighbourhood.
As fate would have it, he is a classmate to one of the children of the ‘big men’ in town.
While the child of the poor driver comes to school barefooted and in completely worn out school uniform, his classmate is brought to school every morning by a chauffeur-driven car.
The boy’s food basket is usually the most sought after one during the break time.
The irony however is this- each time the school closes for the session, the son of the poor driver always takes the first position while his classmate, the child of the rich man, takes the last position.
The rich man has it; but he cannot, by His design, have it all.
Have you ever found yourself in situations where people demand favours from you, favours you cannot grant unto yourself? What about the Vice-Chancellor of that university whose children have continually failed the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) organized by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB).
He presides over life-long opportunities; opportunities none of his children can by law enjoy.
He has this; he does not have that because he cannot have it all!.

``We shall develop and enhance safety enforcement, minimise environmental damage and provide clear framework to enable investors to participate in maritime projects to improve growth and competiveness within the subsector,’’ Moghalu said.
He said that measures were installed to address challenges by ensuring efficiency and cost effectiveness in the industry, as well as the privatisation of the port.
There’s a lot of talk about toilets lately.
After the Obama administration told US schools to let transgender pupils use toilets matching their gender identity, everyone has an opinion about who should use which toilet.
Meanwhile in the interest of public service, I’d also like to encourage a debate about “how” toilets are used.
I encourage male readers to pay particular attention because I’m asking you to stop peeing on rather than in the toilet.
Were an alien species to conduct an in-depth study of the human species, they would say of Nigerian men – a well-adapted group, intellectually vigorous, entrepreneurial and charming, but with disgraceful toilet manners.
Of course there would be exceptions and some women would be similarly judged.
But the good number of male “splashers” amidst us would bring the score down.
Since aliens may not land on earth in my lifetime, I conducted my own in-depth study about this corrosive issue.
The study did not (thankfully) involve visits to the Gents.
Rather it was undertaken (reluctantly) in the one given place where all genders share toilets, namely on airplanes.
The study confirmed that using the shared toilets on flights to and from Nigeria is an extraordinarily unpleasant experience.
In fact, the situation is such that on my next Nigeria bound flight I will bring a raincoat, rubber gloves and Wellies.
Jokes aside, toilet use is in truth a political issue.
Fela Anikulapo-Kuti himself often connected the scatological with the political.
Though judging by the lines, “Long time ago African man no dey carry shit, we dey shit inside big big hole, na European man teach us to carry shit”, Fela may have disagreed with me on toilet matters.
Because in a sense, I am indeed advocating for western toilet habits.
(By the way, I never imagined I would combine those last three words.).
Moghalu, then, said that developing a policy framework to include strategic objectives, policy action and strategic plan for implementation to precede reforming the transport sector.
To be clear, had we modernized the old African way of using the toilet to contemporary society it would be better suited both for the environment and for our bodies.
But I’m thankful that at least airplanes don’t use the hole system, or I would need to add a diving suit to my in-flight gear.
Toilet use is not only a political matter, but also a “geopolitical” one.
I hate to admit it, but I find myself making toilet habit comparisons between countries.
It turns out that flights to and from the US are a particularly “dry” experience.
When you enter a toilet cubicle that has just been used by an American man, nine out of ten times it will be pristine.
Maybe American men go to a special toilet training school? Or maybe they are just particularly good at tactical target aiming.
[Sarcasm].
Whatever the case may be, I see no reason why my countrymen can’t show equal consideration to their fellow human beings.
Tottenham Hotspur’s South Korean striker Son Heung-Min (L) and Tottenham Hotspur’s Belgian defender Toby Alderweireld (R) celebrate on the pitch after the English Premier League football match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur at the Molineux stadium in Wolverhampton, central England on December 15, 2019.
Tottenham won the game 2-1. Paul ELLIS / AFP.
``It is on this basis that we have decided to engage the civil society and all other stakeholders in the maritime subsector in the South East Geopolitical Zone.
Jan Vertonghen’s stoppage time header continued Tottenham’s turnaround under Jose Mourinho as Spurs moved up to fifth with a 2-1 win at Wolves.
Mourinho’s men were largely outplayed at Molineux, but were ruthless with their chances to inflict Wolves’ first league defeat in 12 games.
Adama Traore’s spectacular strike had cancelled out Lucas Moura’s early opener before Vertonghen stooped to guide home Christan Eriksen’s corner.
Spurs can now move into the top four before Christmas if they beat Chelsea at home next weekend.
That speaks volumes for the impact Mourinho has made in less than a month in charge as Tottenham trailed Chelsea and the top four by 12 points when he was appointed.
Wolves drop to eighth as their longest unbeaten run in the top flight since 1962 came to an end, but there was little more Nuno Espirito Santo’s men could have done to at least avoid defeat.
After an industrious start by Wolves, it was Spurs who scored after eight minutes.
Son Heung-min’s drive was beaten away by Rui Patricio but the ball was worked to Moura, who glided into the area before rifling in high from an angle for his third goal in seven games under Mourinho.
Wolves remained undaunted though and after Paulo Gazzaniga gathered Traore’s low effort they began to create openings.
Diogo Jota was a menace and it was from his work Raul Jimenez nearly levelled after 26 minutes but his low effort flashed wide.
Soon after Jota was denied by the recovering Davinson Sanchez after the defender’s initial mistake allowed the forward through.
Wolves continued to dominate but should have been 2-0 down nine minutes before the break.
Referee Stuart Attwell played a good advantage after Moura was fouled to allow Eric Dier forward.
He played a cute one-two with Dele Alli to leave the midfielder with just Patricio to beat but his low strike hit the post.
It would have been harsh on Wolves and they continued to push after the break.
Jota failed to turn in Traore’s cross and Gazzaniga pushed away Jimenez’s shot.
Spurs’ defence had lived dangerously, with Vertonghen in particular struggling against the pace of Traore.
Wolves finally got their reward on 67 minutes.
Traore had given the visitors problems all game and he made them pay, collecting Jimenez’s pass and unleashing a rocket which flew past Gazzaniga from 20 yards.
Tottenham then never looked like restoring their lead before the late drama.
Wolves remained the aggressors and Romain Saiss’ glancing header four minutes later forced Gazzaniga into a fine stop.
But Spurs silenced the hosts in the first minute of injury time when Vertonghen nodded in Eriksen’s corner.
Manish Rohtagi is the Business Head for Simba Group of Companies.
Simba Group has reiterated its commitment to empowering more Nigerians through its products and services.
Business Head of Simba TVS, Mr Manish Rohtagi, speaks on partnership with some Microfinance Banks, while banks should lend more to customers, the business environment, economy and challenges faced by businesses operating in the country.
What is Simba Group all about?.
Simba Group has been in this country for over 30 years.
We started our business with bicycles and bicycle parts way back in 1988.
We are present in several key sectors that are critical to the development of the Nigerian economy including transport, power, IT, agriculture etc.
The office you are in is the headquarters of our transport business.
We in partnership with TVS Motors India are the largest manufacturers of kekes (tricycles) in Nigeria and our two wheelers, also known colloquially as okadas, continue to reshape the Nigerian two-wheeler market.
How does the TVS brand help the Nigerian Economy?.
Transport is essential to the functioning of any economy and is one of the main drivers of it.
Our products address the last mile transport needs of Nigerians.
It has been shown each tricycle or motorcycle sold creates employment for around four people as these machines not only require riders, but also mechanics, dealers and spares distributors etc.
That’s even without considering our own employees.
Hence this industry is one of the biggest employment generators in the country.
Along with that we have been running several programmes that empower the youth of the country.
We have worked with several government agencies including National Automotive Design Development Council (NADDAC), National Directorate of Employment (NDE) among others and trained countless people into becoming keke riders or mechanics for free.
We also try to partner with the State and Federal Governments so that we empower more and more youths.
Could you tell us a bit about Simba Group’s other companies?.
As I mentioned earlier, along with transportation, Simba Group is into power backup.
Our Luminous Inverters are the most popular inverter brand in the country, we are also heavily investing in the development of solar energy.
Other companies in the group include Simba Agric where we focus on mechanisation which includes tractors and irrigation systems – both responsible for increasing agricultural productivity.
Simba Cycles sells bicycles, SimbaNET provides business connectivity solutions to corporates and Simba Infrastructure offers Business Communication Solutions in partnership with Avaya.
But basically, the focus area for me is transportation.
What have been the challenges so far?.
We get lots of support from government institutions but there is still a huge opportunity for public and private sector financial institutions to increase the access to cheap and collateral-free borrowing, in order to provide a major boost to the industry, and the economy at large.
How many financial institutions have helped?.
There has been much progress, and impetus from the Central Bank as well.
But there’s still a long way to go before we really begin to see efficient financial models coming into play.
There are few microfinance banks who have partnered with us and things are getting better.
If many more banks can come and offer people loans to buys kekes and okadas at a subsidised rate or even collateral free, then things will move much faster.
What are your projections for the nearest future?.
We see limitless growth potential in the country and the growth quantum can be much bigger than any other countries.
Nigeria can be among the top 10 economies in the world.
I truly believe that, and our investments in the economy certainly reflect that.
Is your organisation into any Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities?.
CSR has always been integral to the Simba Group.
As part of our group philosophy of empowerment, even our CSR programmes follow the same ideology.
At the heart of our offering is our emphasis on training- something that we provide free of charge to mechanics and engineers who aspire to be mini-entrepreneurs or gainfully employed in the industries we represent.
We have intervened in times of national disaster, such as our actions and contributions during the recent Kano floods, and have been praised for our contributions to the victims of that terrible atrocity.
We believe in wome empowerment very strongly, and our efforts to support the development of women, have taken two forms.
Firstly, we have partnered with the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD) to distribute cycles to girl students to encourage them to attend school.
And secondly, we run the Queen Riders programme – a programme in which we train and certify women from under-privileged backgrounds to become Keke riders and help them on the path to self-employment by harnessing the ecosystem of financiers that we have created.
Celebrating its 125 years of research and impacts, the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, has acknowledged the positive impacts of a homegrown technological device developed in Nigeria on value chain development of the root and tuber crops in Africa.
The institute admits that smallholder farmers have benefited and would continue to improve their means of livelihood with the use of value-adding devices in the post-harvest management of their roots and tubers.
The device, called flash dryer, dries agricultural products such as yam, cassava, potato and other granulated food commodities for elongated shelf life, higher profitability and food security.
The project that propped up the improvement of the design by Nobex Technologies was an initiative of Cassava: Adding Value for Africa (CAVA), facilitated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and executed through multiple partnership.
One of the ways CAVA2 supports smallholders is by offering farmers more ‘avenues for sales’ for their cassava roots.
To ensure a smooth flow of roots from farm to product, CAVA2 works with SMEs to expand and develop processing capacity; a key issue is the availability of quality equipment and after sales service.
The Nigerian who developed the device in working with the institute, Mr Idowu Adeoya, fabricates equipment for drying and roasting root and tuber crops.
The improvement to the flash dryer, which dries agricultural products almost instantaneously, was started in 2006 when the fabricator was first contacted by specialists from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), led by the Country Manager of CAVA Nigeria, Professor Lateef Sanni, and a food processing specialist from NRI, Dr Andrew Graffham, from the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, the United Kingdom.
As part of a FUNAAB-NRI collaboration, they had encountered a Nobex flash dryer at a factory in Akure, 300km from Lagos.
The team was interested in collecting some data about the dryer, in order to look into its efficiency.
Mr Adeoya welcomed Dr Graffham’s interest and some months later, he was visited by NRI agricultural engineering specialist, Dr Andrew Marchant.
Improvements included reduced fuel usage from 374 to 65 litres per tonne of dried product; increased output from approximately 100kg an hour to around 330kg an hour of dried product; and increased efficiency, from 11 to 55 percent.
Building on CAVA2’s experience and progress with the fabricator in Nigeria, a complementary initiative is taking shape in Ghana, with the development of a new, fuel-efficient flash dryer on a smaller scale.
The University of Lagos, UNILAG Muslim Community, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the merit award conferred on dedicated Nigerians who have proved to be exceptional in public service.
Chairman, UNILAG Muslim Community, Prof.
Lai Olurode, in a commendation letter made available to The Guardian, applauded the recognition of the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service, Hameed Ali and that of Registrar, Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof.
Ishaq Oloyede as deserving of productivity merit award.
Olurode said: “The two institutions are truly exceptional and had really shown that we need not be consistently skeptical about our own goodness.
“Perhaps, there are thousands outside of these two individuals who can perform far better.
The lesson in these exceptional case studies is for other public office holders to take note of factors that had assisted the rise of these organizations to pockets of effectiveness,” he stated.
Olurode however enjoined government to ensure that other moribund institutions rise to performance.
“At the UNILAG Muslim Community, we congratulate them for their being specially recognised by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
We urge them to keep up the good job and begin to mentor others for institutional effectiveness so that their exit would not usher a reversal of successes that had been attained.
Individuals cannot travel far but institutions can,” he said.
He said that measures were installed to address challenges by ensuring efficiency and cost effectiveness in the industry, as well as the privatisation of the port.
Although it has been temporarily suspended by the Federal Government, there are, however, several underlining factors that still surround the operations of the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD).
``We shall develop and enhance safety enforcement, minimise environmental damage and provide clear framework to enable investors to participate in maritime projects to improve growth and competiveness within the subsector,’’ Moghalu said.
Mr Ezenwa Nwagwu, Chairman , Partners for Electoral Reforms (PEF) says the jailing of former Gov. Orji Kalu of Abia was a proof that joining the ruling party with criminal case was not a guarantee against justice.
Nwagwu in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja said that the jailing has faulted the notion that once people with criminal record join the ruling party they were covered.
NAN reports that Kalu was on Thursday convicted of corruption and sentenced to 12 years in prison by a Federal High Court in Lagos after he was found guilty of N7.2 billion fraud and money laundering.
“The judgment is a good boost for the anti-corruption fight, especially against the background of all the noise about once somebody is in the All Progressives Congress (APC) the person cannot be brought to justice.

“It is a good signal that even if you join the ruling party you will not clog the will of justice.
“It also signals the fact that no matter how long it last, once there is the determination by the court to bring justice, justice would be done.
“ We are excited about the judgment and we hope that it is also brought to bear on the Babachir Lawal’s case and other cases of people with a criminal record who think that being in the ruling party is a guarantee against justice,’’ he said
Lassa fever kills two, infects 10 in five states
Lassa fever has claimed two more lives in Abia and Edo states as the country approaches the peak season for outbreaks of the deadly disease.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June.
Latest figures from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), confirmed 10 new cases of the disease in five states: five in Ondo, two in Edo, one each in Ebonyi, Bauchi and Abia. In those new cases, one person each died in Edo and Abia states.
Man, 26, drowns at National Stadium, Surulere
One Sodiq Yusuf, 26, of No. 26, Horgan Bassey Street, Surulere, has said to have drowned at National Stadium, Surulere.
The police in Lagos on Sunday said that a 26-year-old man, Sodiq Yusuf, had drowned inside the National Stadium swimming pool, Surulere.
Lagos Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, said in a statement that a team of policemen was immediately mobilised to the scene.

Nasarawa Assembly to enact law to protect women, children against violence
The Nasarawa State House of Assembly says it will enact a law that will protect women and children against violence in the interest of development of the state and the country. Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, the Speaker of the House, stated this on Tuesday when the state women led by the State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Hajiya Halima Jabiru, led the campaign rally on violence against women to the House.
He said that the law if enacted would protect, respect and promote the rights of women and children in order to improve their health and their standard of living.
READ ALSO: Abia Assembly moves to pass law prohibiting violence against all Persons
“ We will enact any relevant law that will put to end violence against women and children in the state.
“We believe that the law if enacted will also protect the rights of women and children for the overall development of the state,” he said.
Abdullahi called on all Nigerians to protect women and children from all forms of violence for development to thrive in the state and the country.
“ Every Nigerian should ensure that women and children are protected and are not put under unnecessary violence,” he said.
Earlier, Hajiya Halima Jabiru, the state Commissioner for Women Affairs, said that they were in the assembly to seek for the legislature’s support on crusade on violence against women.
“As you can see that our women carried different placards with inscriptions such as say no to rape , no to violence against women.
NASS inauguration: Dozie Nwankwo unifies citizens as he returns
Anambra state citizens, especially those of the Njikoka, Dunukofia and Anaocha councils have been reassured of abundant democracy dividends by Chief Dozie Nwankwo, who took oath of office last Thursday as he was formally inaugurated by the leadership of the Federal House of Representatives, Abuja.
Nwankwo was sworn in after successfully reclaiming his mandate at the Court of Appeal Elections Petitions tribunal, Enugu Division on Nov 1,2019.
The inauguration which was witnessed by all and sundry, including the Minister of Transportation, Chibike Amechi, Anambra deputy Governor Nkem Okeke, Senators Victor Umeh and Rochas Okorocha, Obiora Okonkwo, national and state assemblies members, ended with a dinner.
Nigeria may miss SDG on healthcare, says Soludo
Former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has said that if the Federal Government does not initiate good reforms, the country may miss out on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on healthcare.
Soludo spoke at the 26th Annual Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) Development Forum themed ‘The Nigerian Healthcare Situation: The Way Forward’ in Abuja.
According to him, tackling healthcare challenges in the country requires decisive and comprehensive war on poverty, inequality, illiteracy or poor public health education, nutrition, water and sanitation, as well as provision of adequate and accessible public health facilities and insurance schemes.
“The United Nations SDG 3 envisions that by 2030 all countries should ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.“There are about 13 specific targets to meet.
From all indications, Nigeria is set to miss the targets and the SDG on health except some dramatic and systematic reforms are initiated and sustained from now until 2030,” he said.
Government’s expenditure on health (like other sectors) needs to be ratcheted up and its facilitation and regulatory functions strengthened, he said, adding that serious attention at fora like that, should also focus on maximising the latent potential of the ‘other hand’ (individuals and non-state actors) in reversing what LAPO identifies as the ‘progressive decline’ of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.
He noted that the country’s healthcare statistics was as scary as its poverty and unemployment statistics, using the average life expectancy as summary indicator.
The former governorship aspirant in Anambra State identified a strong correlation between poverty/inequality and health.He explained that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provided for free and compulsory primary education, as well as free secondary education.
In his opening remarks, chairman, LAPO Board of Directors, Dr. Osarenren Emokpae, called on the federal and state governments to increase budgetary allocation for the health sector.He said the increment would help reduce medical tourism, as some of the elite would begin to patronise local health facilities rather than go abroad.
In 2018, Nigeria was ranked 187 out of 191 countries in the world that are not complying with the Universal Health Coverage (UCH), he noted, adding that LAPO, in its inclusive services to its clients and the general public, made healthcare a very important component of its services.The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LAPO, Godwin Ehigiamusoe, said the country’s health sector required urgent and collective attention and action, adding that the healthcare statistics in some cases were very depressing.
Nnamdi Kanu’s lawyer declared wanted
The police in Anambra State have declared Ifeanyi Ejiofor, a lawyer to leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu wanted.
“I will like to let Nigerians to know that as we speak, Barrister Ejiofor, an IPOB member and his cohorts have been declared wanted by the command,” Anambra police commissioner in the state, John Abang, said on Tuesday.
“And I will seek the cooperation of law-abiding Nigerians from North, South, East and West, wherever they find this individual, they should report to the nearest police station or any other security agency for possible arrest and prosecution.”
One dead, two injured in road crash on Lagos-Abeokuta expressway

Residents flee town of Kanu’s lawyer after policemen’s death
A siege allegedly laid to Oraifite in Ekwusigo Local Government of Anambra State by a combined team of soldiers and policemen forced residents to flee the community yesterday.
The desertion of the community came on the heels of declaration of Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lawyer to the Supreme Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, wanted by the state police command over an alleged killing of Oliver Innoma Abbey, the Oraifite Area Commander and the SARS Commander, Ichi Sector, Patrick Agbazue.
The two officers led a police patrol team to the compound of Ejiofor in Oraifite, where the police allegedly shot at three persons and wounded scores of others suspected to belong to IPOB.
It was learnt that the seeming police invasion of the house of the counsel to Kanu, who had three days earlier buried one of his elder brothers, irked some youths in the area who allegedly launched a reprisal attack, which is believed to have resulted in the death of Abbey and Agbazue whose remains were burnt and buried near a village market.
The police and IPOB have given differing accounts of the incident in which not less than 20 houses and shops have been razed.
Revving critical national issues as Madueke launches autography
Admiral Allison MaduekeNo doubt, the story of the 30-month Nigerian Civil War of 1967 would remain a critical point for discussion anytime Nigeria is being examined in history to project for a better future. So also the agitation for restructuring and June 12, 1993, presidential election, acclaimed to have been won by the late business mogul, Chief M.K.O Abiola but annulled by the then military Head of State, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. These issues seem recurring and cannot be overlooked as they impact on national discourse.
Twenty-one years since Nigeria returned to civil rule, those factors that led to the civil war, the unending agitations for restructuring and the perceived domination of governance system by a particular section of the country are still visible markers that still haunt the country and continue to stifle its development. As a matter of fact, most of the issues have not been adequately tackled many leas put in proper perspectives in a manner that could have helped in reshaping the nation’s growth and development.
These factors were part of issues that were publicly deliberated upon, when former Chief of Naval Staff and one-time Military Administrator of Anambra and the Imo State, Admiral Allison Madueke (rtd), launched his autobiography last week. It is entitled Riding the Storms, with God in My Sails at MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos.
Seeking inclusiveness through regional development commissions
Oduah
The quest for the establishment of development commissions for the remaining geo-political zones in the country apart from the South-south and Northeast gained momentum recently with the introduction of three bills to that effect in the Senate.
ONYEDIKA AGBEDO looks at the genesis of the move, the gimmicks around it and its likely outcome in this report.
There is a cool ‘war’ in the Senate among the geo-political zones in the country following penultimate Wednesday’s reintroduction of a bill seeking to establish the South East Development Commission. The 8th Senate had passed the bill, sponsored by Senator Stella Oduah (PDP, Anambra North) on December 12, 2018, but it did not get President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent.
Should the bill secure the nod of the lawmakers again and possibly receive presidential assent this time around, it would give birth to a commission charged with the responsibility of receiving and managing funds specially allocated by the Federal Government for the rehabilitation, reconstruction and reparation for lost houses and businesses of victims of the Nigerian civil war.
The commission would also address any other environmental or developmental challenges confronting the zone.
Clause 15 (2a) of the bill, which identifies source of funding for the commission, stipulates that the equivalent of 10 per cent of the total monthly statutory allocation due to the member states of the commission shall be from the Federation Account.
It also seeks the establishment of a governing board for the commission, which shall include one person each from the other five geopolitical zones of the country.
South-East NYSC coordinator inaugurates entrepreneurship centre in Aba
Alhaji Ahmed Ikaka, the South East Zonal Coordinator, National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), on Tuesday inaugurated a new Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Department (SAED) Centre built by corps members serving in Osisioma, near Aba.
Speaking at the event, Ikaka lauded the efforts of the corps members, saying that NYSC was leading the economic revolution in Nigeria with the skill acquisition training given to corps members.
He assured Nigerians of better economy with the series of training given to corps members to make them self-reliant.
He said that Nigeria had no reason to be patronising foreign goods when its youths creatively produce such goods.
READ ALSO: The NYSC uniform controversy
The NYSC boss, therefore, urged Nigerians to patronise local manufacturers and assist them to strengthen their economy.
“We should produce what we consume. We have the best skills in the world. You have seen from the exhibition we had here the production of shoes, hats, clothings and other things.
“We have seen also those in agro-allied, food production and processing.
“We cannot be deceiving ourselves, no nation develops on importation. The life of a nation depends on the skills of its citizens and none develops beyond the citizens’ skills.
“So NYSC is changing Nigeria’s narrative by developing the skills of these corps members and they are becoming job creators, instead of job seekers.
“A lot of NYSC members are contributing to the economic development of our nation.
“This is the only way we can move forward, we cannot continue to deceive ourselves,” Ikaka said.
He said that corps members had learnt to write business proposals, given loan windows with Bank of Industry offering N2 billon, Central Bank providing N400 million, Heritage Bank fund, NYSC Foundation fund and Credit Direct fund.
He said with about N10 million available for corps members to access, it will be easy for them to succeed outside the service and improve Nigeria’s economy.
The state NYSC Coordinator, Lady Bona Fasakin, said that Osisioma Local Government Area (LGA) had been partners in progress with NYSC.
Fasakin said that the council provided the land, where the centre was built, adding that by that act the council had keyed into the vision of the scheme in its fight against unemployment.
She urged other councils and stakeholders in Abia to emulate Osisioma’s example by providing skills training equipment to sustain the vision and ensure that corps members become job providers.
She further called for support for NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers so that rural dwellers would benefit from the programme.
The Transition Chairman of Osisioma LGA, Mr Ugochukwu Nwaogu, said the council would continue to assist in making life better for the corps members serving in the area.
Nwaogu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Joseph Iguodo, said the council would seek ways to provide a lodge for corps members in the area.
The council boss pledged N50,000 donation to support NYSC programmes in the area.
The Local Government Zonal Inspector, Mrs Ruth Jacob, thanked the council for its support, while commending the corps members for their commitment in actualising the project.
Jacob said that the centre had taught the corps members how to produce many items that could enhance their economy and contribute to the nation’s socio-economic development.
(Updated) Supreme court removes prominent Oyo monarch, Eleruwa of Eruwa
Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola
By Adeola Badru
Twenty-one years after he ascended the throne of his forebears, the Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola has been dethroned by the Supreme Court on Friday morning.
Vanguard recalls that an Oyo State High Court had on January 26, 2011 removed. But not satisfied, he appealed the judgement.
The sacked monarch was installed the Eleruwa in 1998 by the Oyo State Government amidst protracted protests by members of the rightful ruling house after the last Eleruwa, the late Oba Bolanle Olaniyan, who is from the Akalako ruling house, passed on , on May 1, 1994.
Although his nomination and selection by the kingmakers were challenged by the Laribikusi house, which argued that he was not a member of the ruling arm, but belonged to Akalako where the previous king emerged, the state government went ahead to inaugurate him, prompting the present action.

Those who challenged the authenticity of Adegbola’s claims to the throne are Mr. James Olatunde Idowu and Alhaji Ajao.
Joined in the suit besides Adegbola are: the Governor of Oyo State, the Attorney General, Ibarapa Local Government, Chief Jacob Adewusi, Chief Femi Atanda, Chief Idowu Okeowo, Chief E. Ojebisi and Mr. Kasali I.
The plaintiffs, represented by the lawyer, Alhaji Lasun Sanusi (SAN) sought eight reliefs in their statement of claims which were all granted by the court.
Having summarized all the submissions of the counsel to both sides, Justice Abimbola resolved all the issues in favour of the plaintiffs.
When Nigeria’s slow wheel of justice caught up with Uzor Kalu
After a 12-year trial period, Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, was yesterday brought to book for offences committed against his people. In the wake of Nigeria’s return to democratic governance in 1999, Kalu was one of the governors elected to steer the affairs of the states of the federation and help fulfill the yearnings of the masses for purposeful governance and true development. But amid actions that simulated development and got praise singers christening him ‘the messiah,’ he plundered the state’s till, grossly under-developed his people and set the tone for their sustained impoverishment.
Shortly after stepping down as governor in 2007, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) took him to court on a 39-count charge bordering on diversion of about N7.65 billion from the state’s purse. And yesterday, after a drawn trial, he was handed a 12-year jail sentence at a Federal High Court in Lagos by presiding judge, Mohammed Idris, for money laundering.
In addition to the sentence, Justice Idris ordered that Kalu’s company, Slok Nigeria Limited, be liquidated and its assets forfeited to the Federal Government.
The senator, Slok Nigeria Limited and Udeh Udeogu, a former director of finance and accounts in Abia, were found complicit in the diversion.

Betty Akeredolu: We’ll not relent until women are treated fairly
The wife of Ondo State governor, Arabinrin Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, has vowed not to relent until women are given equal rights as their male counterparts.
Mrs Anyanwu-Akeredolu spoke on Wednesday during the 2nd summit of Forum for Women Officials of Ondo State and Female Appointees (FOWOSO) held at International Culture and Event Centre in Akure, the state capital.
“We will not faint until we see women everywhere being treated with as much respect as their male counterparts.
“The pursuit of gender quality is definitely daunting, many rocks of stereotypes are particularly exerting, but when men join us, we are further strengthened to prevail quickly. But, whatever the case , we shall prevail,” she said.
She called for gender inclusiveness in all aspects of the socio-economic, saying that ‘ spectrum is still miles ahead. We know this and we are not going to relent.’
Anyanwu-Akeredolu, who is the founder of FOWOSO, noted that her motivation was not because she is a woman.
She called for a society where continuous development was achieved and sustained.
“We must come to the understanding that everyone, regardless of gender is needed for sustainable development.
“I have dedicated my life to driving gender equality, not because I love female folk more ,but because I seek the growth and advancement of humanity as a whole.
“I am very delighted to know that I have infected every FOWOSO member with this positive virus that strives for gender equality in every aspect of our socio-economic spectrum,” she explained.
Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu described as unquantifiable the training and empowerment of women in the state by FOWOSO.
He said the activities of the forum, particularly in the areas of training and empowerment of women across the 18 local government areas, had produced many entrepreneurs.
Speaking on the theme of the summit; “Prioritising Women’s Health and Well Being In Nigeria”, Akeredolu said his administration had prioritised the well-being of women in the state.
He added: “We have prioritised women health and well-being in Ondo State and that was what led to the Abiyamo Maternal and Child Health Scheme which we launched on Wednesday. All you need to access the free health care for pregnant women is your residency cards. Every child under 5 is entitled to free health care in Ondo State.”
“Let me commend the efforts of the founder for this laudable initiative geared towards the development of womenfolk in Ondo State,” Akeredolu stated.
The Chairman of 2nd FOWOSO Planning Committee, Mrs Mercy Femi-Idris, described the forum as significant to health and welfare of women, adding that it was about nurturing and empowering female folks.
Prof. Modupe Adelabu, the Chairman of the occasion, noted that FOWOSO had given women voice of recognition.
Adelabu, the former director governor of Ekiti State, said the forum had eliminated discrimination against women, noting that FOWOSO was a fun-making gathering but a life-impacful organisation.
Mrs Bisi Fayemi, the wife of Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi and Mrs Kafayat Oyetola, the wife of Osun State governor attended the summit.
How to boost cyber security – experts
Stakeholders the Nigerian cyber security space under the aegis of the Information Security Society of Africa-Nigeria (ISSAN) have called for collaborations in boosting cyber security in the country.
They made the call while speaking at a Cyber Security Workshop Themed: “DDoS Evolution – Staying Protected” organised by ISSAN in collaboration with 21st Century Technologies Limited in Lagos.
While welcoming stakeholders at the Workshop, President of ISSAN, Dr. David Isiavwe, decried the worsening state of cyber security in the country.
He said, “Those who watch the cyber space closely, will all agree that there is a lot of happenings each and every day. New forms of attacks are being contrived and implemented by the bad guys, and all they need is one successful attempt. We hear of all the various attacks both on individuals and companies alike. Indeed, even the cyber security gatekeepers are not spared. And huge sums of money are at risk each time there is a successful attack.”
Dr. Isiavwe who is also the Group Head Operations & Technology, Ecobank Nigeria Limited, further lamented the fact that everyone and every institution was susceptible to these attacks as social engineering attack is unrelenting.
He said data based manipulation-insiders and outsiders is on the rise, attack on card data and card processing technology infrastructure via rogue IT infrastructure, spear phishing attack and combination of different methodologies were rampant.
He therefore called on all stakeholders to be proactive, create customer awareness activities, continuous and automated monitoring of systems and infrastructure, employment of Artifucial intelligence and Machine Learning as well as robotics and data analytics.
He also called for collaborations among stakeholders.
Speaking on the theme of the workshop in a keynote address, Long Lee Shih – DDoS Security Expert, Nexusguard Ltd, also explained how individuals and organisations could avoid being victims of cyber attacks, including Origin Protection (OP) for large networks, among others.
His keynote address was followed by a robust plenary session that included Dr Wale Obadare, MD/COO, Digital Encode Ltd; Long Lee Shih, Ighoakpo Eduje, Chief Information Security Officer, Heritage Bank Ltd; Igboa Abumere, Chief Information Security Officer, Stanbic IBTC Bank; Bharat Soni, Chief Information Security Officer, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Dr. David Isiavwe.
Hit-and-run driver kills woman in Awka
A yet to be identified woman was on Sunday killed by a hit-and-run driver in Awka.
The accident occurred at about 11:05pm at Regina Caeli Junction on the Enugu-Onitsha expressway.
According to Mr Andrew Kumapayi, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Anambra, the accident left the woman dead instantly.
Kumapayi said the corpse had been deposited at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital morgue, Awka.
The sector commander reiterated the call for pedestrians to be careful on the road, especially during festive periods, because of increased vehicular movement.
“My advice to road users especially pedestrians during this season is to be extra careful when crossing the road.
“They should endeavour to use the pedestrian bridge provided for them if any, and if there is none, they should look left, right and left again to make sure that the road is free before crossing.
“Let them wear reflective clothes when walking in the night so that they can be seen by oncoming vehicles,” he said.
What Onitsha fire tells us about the petrol tankers from hell [Pulse Opinion]
The Onitsha fire accident was totally avoidable. Yet again, Nigeria has killed citizens whose only crime was hustling in a country that never got their backs.
Onitsha, the Anambra state capital, is mourning. And all of Nigeria with it.
On Wednesday, October 16, 2019, a petrol laden tanker rammed into buildings in an Onitsha market, spilled its contents in the neigborhood and sparked a fire that ravaged buildings, consumed goods worth millions of Naira and ended lives.
Onitsha was a ball of fire for hours and no one lifted a finger. The city is still counting its losses.
The casualty figures from the incident are still hazy at the time of writing, but it has been confirmed that a mother and her child were among the dead; with the fire searing through their skins and leaving them locked in each other's arms until the very end.
The fire incident in Onitsha yesterday is sad and regrettable. I am profoundly touched by the sight of the charred remains of an innocent mother and her child, who are victims of this tragedy,” said President Muhammadu Buhari.
Former Nigeria Vice President and presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar said: “We've had many preventable fuel tanker tragedies. I received with sadness, reports of a tanker explosion in Onitsha, Anambra State, which caused massive destruction to lives and properties in Ochanja Market area. My prayers and thoughts are with the families of the affected.”
TV personality Ebuka Obi-Uchendu said: “Last night was a lot. We really are on our own in this country... Those images from Onitsha are still so heartbreaking. May the departed Rest In Peace.”
One of the biggest takeaways from the tragedy is that the fire raged for hours with no fire service truck anywhere near the scene of the inferno. And like Atiku mentioned, this is one of several petrol tanker accidents in recent times across Nigeria that has led to loss of lives.
Apart from the Otedola bridge fire incident of June 2018 in Lagos that led to loss of lives and the burning of cars, there have been several instances where a petrol laden tanker, flouting all known traffic laws in the land, goes ahead to inflict pain and misery on innocent families and ordinary Nigerians.
In Lagos where this writer resides, petrol tanker and articulated truck drivers derive immense joy from intimidating other road users, offloading their containers on busy roads and obstructing free flow of traffic.
Articulated trucks and petrol tankers have been a menace in Nigeria for as long as anyone can remember and the regulatory agencies or authorities have largely looked the other way unperturbed for decades. Until the next disaster.
“I call on the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other stakeholders to urgently address the issue of safety standards in Nigeria, with a view to stemming the frequency of these tragedies. May the souls of the dead rest in peace Amen,” President Buhari said, without stating how he will make sure the agencies he mentioned sanitize our roads and put the killer truck drivers in check. Without saying how he'll lead the charge in enforcing compliance.
It is also a shame that a state as rich as Anambra has no functioning fire service department or emergency response units; and that when tragedy struck, Governor Willie Obiano was not on the ground to provide succour.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the Onitsha inferno was completely avoidable. Yet again, we have lost lives to poor governance across all tiers. Writer Ayo Sogunro was right after all when he said “everything in Nigeria is going to kill you."
TRAFFIC CONTROL IN FESTIVE SEASON, TRANSPORT MINISTRY LAUNCH ATMA SPECIAL MARSHAL VESTS
By Chukwuka Ugokwe /Ifunanya Ajukwu :
Awka, Dec. 9, 2019 (MOI) Anambra State Commissioner for Transport, Dr Christian Madubuko has asked officers of the Anambra Traffic Control Agency(ATMA) and other stakeholders in the sector to intensify operations aimed at ensuring safety on the roads.
According to him, there is need for all traffic control agencies in the state to work together this festive period to facilitate free vehicular

Dr Madubuko noted that as helmsman in the ministry, he often moved around to monitor the performance of officers at their various duty posts to assess their level of commitment.
Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of ATMA, Mr Pat Obiefuna, described the theme of the seminar: ``Drive Right And Save Time’’ , as apt, especially at this period of the year.
He emphasised the readiness of the agency to partner with relevant stakeholders in the transport sector to curb challenge of road crashes often caused by drivers.
The ATMA boss commended Gov. Obiano for installing traffic control lights to assist in easing off traffic jams, stressing that road crashes could be avoided by drivers, who obey signs.
Assistant Corps Commander, Ike Egwuokike, who represented the State Sector Commander of the Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC), Mr Andrew Kumakpayi, called on motorists to undergo training at approved Driving Schools before plying the road.
He enjoined them to present their vehicles for routine checks and abide by traffic rules and regulations to ensure safety on ``the Wheels’’.
In a goodwill address, the State Chief Vehicle Inspection Officer (VIO), Mr Emenike Atuegbunam, assured of readiness of his officers to contribute their quota toward guaranteeing accident-free Yuletide.
He added that to achieve the objective of the event, motorists must update their vehicle documents, fix their vehicles to be roadworthy and obey all traffic rules. (MOI)
Former players of Sunshine Stars, Sunshine Queens, Rising Stars and Rising Queens on Tuesday in Akure, Ondo State, disrupted the training session of Sunshine Stars FC over the non-payment of their sign-on fees.
The ex-players chased members of the team away from the Ondo State Sports Complex, Akure.
Former Sunshine Queens player, Esther Michael, told journalists that she got injured while playing for the club but was abandoned to her fate.
Michael added that she had remained without a job since sustaining a career-threatening injury five years ago while playing for the club.
She disclosed that no form of help came from the management of the Ondo State Football Agency since that period.
She said, “For almost five years after I was injured and spent my entire earnings on treating myself, I have had no job.
“We are therefore appealing to Ondo State Government to help us out.
“I played almost five years for this team, the injury I had, government and management didn’t help me. So, they should pay us our money.”
Former Sunshine Stars player, James Moses, said government should honour the agreement it entered into with the players and pay them their sign-on fees.
Moses, fondly called “Okomu’’ in his playing days by fans, said the love they had for the team had prevented them from taking legal action against the management.
He said, “The state has been owing us sign-on fees for long and we have been begging for them to pay us.
“Sunshine was my first club, I love Sunshine so much. I want them to pay us our money that is due to us.
“We are calling on the state governor to help us because some of us have families to take care of.”
In his reaction, Tajudeen Akinyemi, Chairman, Ondo State Football Agency, said the previous government agreed to pay the money in 15 instalments but was only able to offset eight.
Akinyemi said the file for the remaining seven months had been sent to the Head of Service, who had raised the issue with the governor of the state.
He promised that government would accelerate action on the file to ensure that the former players were paid.

Nigerian singer David Adeleke, aka Davido, says there is no money Osun State can make in the next 40 years that his father, Adedeji Adeleke, has not already made as the 'omo baba olowo' crooner revealed why he stayed away from Nigeria for eight months.
A similar controversial statement regarding the paltry financial capacity of Osun was made by the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.
Contrary to beliefs that Davido was away from the country to promote his music on the international scene, the singer said he had to leave the country of some time due to the fillers he was getting that the government was after him.
According to him, he needed to protect his family and associates which he was why he left the country.
The singer made this known at his album private listening event, Wednesday night, which held at Landmark Events, Victoria Island, where he disclosed that if he had chosen to stay things would not have gone smoothly for him as the government were beginning to track his activities.
The singer whose album, 'A Good Time', will be released in October while fielding questions from MTV Base TV host, Ehiz, said, “With the whole politics thing it was first about family. Honestly, it was first about family. I was in Osun with my guys. We saw everything in plain sight. Let me tell you a story about my uncle. My uncle is the last born of the family. The original politician of the family is Serubawon, my father’s elder brother.
“He was the first governor of Osun state; came back then went for senator you know when everybody for the state knows that this is the next governor and then we just woke up one day and they said he went to eat somewhere and he died.
“Yoruba culture when somebody holds an office and he passes on they either give the bride or the close relatives. The next in line is B red’s daddy and he is just a happy person. He doesn’t like politics but when you lose your brother everybody knows what’s up. With that, they wanted to give my uncle automatically.
“A day to them swearing him in as senator they said no we want to do re-election another guy has come up and my father doesn’t like wahala so he said let’s go to the other party if we lose we pack our thing and go. The next day we did election my uncle cleared 16 out of 17 local government areas.
“He became a senator in just a week. His own journey to winning that governorship primary election was out of sight that was how we knew this one nah God.
“It was painful and will tell everybody here that was the real reason I was not even in the country because of the politics. I have to watch what I say. If I was around he no go dey OK for me and my people. So I had to be a man and say look let me stay away.
“We have Adeleke University all the roads that lead was done by my father. There’s no money Osun wants to make in the next 30 to 40 years that my father has not made. The way things turned out was crazy.When asked if he got any backlash for doing what he did, he said no.According to him, he met an APC chieftain at a wedding in Paris wherethey both shared a joke.He said he “felt shebi una don take am".
That’s why I'm back, he explained. "I’m praying every day for the country. Everybody is complaining why you talking about politics. I have an American passport I could have chosen to stay there. But this is home and I am comfortable here.”
EXCLUSIVE: EFCC Quizzes Ondo Poly Bursar, Registrar Over Funds Misappropriation
SaharaReporters gathered on Wednesday that the two men were 'drilled' for authorising the sum of N68m from the treasury of the school without due process.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has quizzed the Registrar of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic Owo, Ondo State, Mr Sule Atiku, and the Bursar of the institution, Mr Matthew Adejuwon, over alleged financial impropriety.
SaharaReporters gathered on Wednesday that the two men were 'drilled' for authorising the sum of N68m from the treasury of the school without due process.
A source, who confided in our correspondent, said that, “The Registrar and Bursar of the institution were at the EFCC on Tuesday and they were quizzed over the role they played in allegedly misappropriating the funds of the institution.
“They were there with their lawyers and brought some documents to defend themselves.
“Our investigations showed that the Bursar had his authorised signature on some of the documents which also implicated him as an accomplice.
Two of them (Bursar and the Registrar) were accomplices in the ongoing corruption and fraud perpetrated at the polytechnic.”     A senior management officer of the school also confirmed the questioning of the two men during a chat SaharaReporters.     He said, “Yes, it is true that the two men have honoured the invite of the EFCC and they have been quizzed but I don't know if they were detained. I noticed I did not see them in school today (Wednesday).”     When contacted on Wednesday evening over the matter, spokesperson for the institution, Mr Ojo Samuel, could not be reached as his telephone line was switched off.     Recall that the EFCC had last month invited and quizzed both the Chairman, Governing Board of the school, Mr Banji Alabi; the Rector, Gani Ogundahunsi; Deputy Rector (Academics), and Mr Olorunwa Lawson after a petition was received by the agency.     Some aggrieved lecturers of the school had accused the management of the institution of allegedly diverting and using some illegal means to misappropriate the school’s fund into private purse.     Sources at the EFCC had earlier told SaharaReporters that there are documents linking the principal officers of the polytechnic to the financial misappropriation.     EXCLUSIVE: Real Reason I was Assaulted –FUTA Student Brutalised By Colleagues     She was attacked by her colleagues for revealing how one of their boyfriends forcefully tried to have an affair with her.     Boluwatife Adekunle, the female undergraduate of the Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, who was physically assaulted by two ladies and a guy all said to be student of the institution, has given more insight into why she was attacked.     The young lady, who says she wants justice served, told SaharaReporters on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital, that she was attacked by her colleagues for revealing how one of their boyfriends forcefully tried to have an affair with her.     Adekunle revealed that she was assaulted in one of the private hostels outside the school campus by the group in a bid to be disgraced among fellow students.     She said, “The whole issue started few weeks ago. I and one of the ladies in the video called 'Faith' were roommates in a hostel outside campus.     “Her boyfriend began asking me out but I felt it was not proper for me to date him. I rejected his advances.     “But instead of him to leave me alone, the guy kept disturbing me, so I had to report him to Faith because I don't want trouble.     See Also     CRIME     FUTA Female Student Brutalised For Calling Colleagues 'Runs Girls'     0 Comments     4 Weeks Ago     “Before then, I had been having some issues with Faith as she had been living a wayward life on campus which I didn't like.     “From that point, she started seeing me as talking bad about her to people around our area.     “During this period, her boyfriend kept pestering me to date him but I refused.     “Instead of Faith to caution her boyfriend, she accused me of planning to sleep with her man.     “On the day that I was assaulted, she invited me to a room in one of the hostels and boyfriend and other ladies were inside the place already.     “Immediately I entered the place, they locked the door and asked me to kneel down while the guy was asking if he ever asked me for a date.     “Since I refused to kneel down, they began to beat me and also tried to strip me naked.     “They used a stick to hit me on my head and punched me on my face. The guy used horse whip to flog me several times.     “They said they would make sure they disgraced me on campus, I pleaded with them but they refused and I was about to faint when they stopped beating me.     “As I speak, I feel pains all over my body due to the beatings. Their plan was to kill me. I want them arrested and face the consequences of their action.”     While condemning the attack on her daughter, the victim’s mother, Mrs Florence Adekunle, said they wanted justice over the matter.     She said, “I was in the church on Sunday when her brother called me that they saw Boluwatife in a video and she was beaten up.     “I can't imagine how friends would treat a fellow student like this. I'm aware that the school authority and even the police have taken up the matter, all the same we want justice.”     Following the incident and the widespread criticism that greeted it, the management of FUTA had announced the indefinite suspension on the students seen in the viral video assaulting Boluwatife.     Spokesperson for the institution, Adegbenro Adebanjo, confirmed this in a statement in Akure on Monday.     He identified the names of those suspended as Popoola Olaniyi Agboola (300L), Oluwadare Faith Tobiloba (200L), Nandi Yohanna Jessica (200L), Ajuwon Tolani Emmanuella (100L), Emmanuel Funmilayo Taiwo (100L) and Alao Olabimpe Cecilia (100L).     According to him, the university would not tolerate any form of indiscipline among students of the institution.     Adebanjo said, “As a consequence of their suspension, they are precluded from all academic and related activities indefinitely and barred from the university and its precincts forthwith.     “At the conclusion of ongoing investigations, the law of the university as contained in the handbook and oath of matriculation which all students are made to sign and subscribe to, will be visited on those found culpable.”     Ondo State Commissioner of Police, Adie Undie, told SaharaReporters that all the students involved would be invited for interrogation.     He said, “We have started investigation on the matter. I have asked my men to brief me continuously on the findings.”     EXCLUSIVE: Supermarket Owners Rake In Huge Profits Over Closure Of Shoprite In Akure     We have been witnessing improved sales and high influx of customers in our store since Shoprite was shut down in Akure due to the protest by some youths.     Some Supermarkets and stores in Akure, Ondo State, are now profiting heavily from the closure of popular mall, Shoprite, SaharaReporters can authoritatively report.     It was observed that impatient customers have begun seeking other means to purchase items in the state by approaching supermarkets and street stores in the city.     Our correspondent, who visited several supermarkets across Akure on Thursday, discovered how customers were trooping in constantly to purchase various items.     Though there have been complains by consumers over the cost of items in many of the supermarkets and stores visited by our correspondent, the crowd in those places did not reduce for the most part of the day.     Manager of one of the stores in the city, Abimbola Chukwudi, told SaharaReporters that they indeed sales had increased for them since the Shoprite outlet in Akure was shut down.     According to her, they were currently overwhelmed with the influx of customers and wish business can remain like this for them.     She said, “We have been witnessing improved sales and high influx of customers in our store since Shoprite was shut down in Akure due to the protest by some youths.     SaharaReporters Media     “In fact, to withstand the large number of customers, we now open all doors to the supermarket so that customers can go in and out easily.     “To be honest, we have been profiting from the closure of Shoprite and we are very happy about this.”     It is the same story for Bimbo Adebakin whose supermarket in the city has also witnessed increased patronage.     According to the middle-aged woman, since the closure of Shoprite, business had flourished so much that she had been smiling to the bank.     “I have requested for two salesgirls to join the four people working at my supermarket at the moment because of the large volume of customers we have been recording since Shoprite was shut down,     “Even customers that had forgotten us for a long time, they have started patronising us again. This is indeed a blessing in disguise for people like me,” she said.     SaharaReporters Media     In the other parts of Akure visited by SaharaReporters, it was a similar tale of job for supermarket and store owners, who said that the entire situation was a way God had used to prosper their businesses – many of which had come under severe threat of even extinction since the arrival of the South African company in the city.     A customer, Iyabo Adebayo, told our correspondent that she has had to rely on supermarkets around her to purchase needed items since the closure of Shoprite in Akure.     “Since Shoprite was shut down, we have to seek another means to buy our goods.     “We have been getting every item need at many of these stores and that is why we are not really feeling the closure of the popular mall,” she said.     The latest development comes barely two days after the Shoprite outlet was shut down over fears of an attack by youths protesting the killing of Nigerians and other African migrants in South Africa.     Expelling Students Over Social Media Posts Is Impunity, Shehu Sani, Segalink Say     The level of impunity in our citadel of knowledge is astronomical."
Former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, and rights activist, Segun Awosanya popularly known as Segalink, have condemned the expulsion of a student of Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, over a Facebook post, an open letter to the Inspector-General of Police and his alliance with pro-democracy and human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore.
Shehu Sani, who took to his Twitter handle to express his grievance, said, "Expelling students and sacking workers over Facebook or Twitter postings is likely to intensify in view of the growing culture of intolerance to criticisms and the establishment discomfort with the social media."Also reacting to the issue, Segalink wrote, "By the grace of God, we shall be taking up this case.
The level of impunity in our citadel of knowledge is astronomical.     An example will be made of this abuse of power by people who should know better.
Kindly advise Ifemosu Michael to reach out, so we can be properly briefed and take up the matter for justice to be served. He is no longer alone.
However, despite the outcry the expulsion of Ifemosu by on the orders of the Vice Chancellor, Prof Felix Salako, the university's management are yet to give any statement on the issue.

Federal Polytechnic Ado Ekiti Bans Students Unionism Over Protest
The students’ body had accused the school’s management of plotting to install a stooge, who would do the management’s bidding as their leader.
The management of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, has shut down the school following students’ protest over the interference of the school’s authorities in the running of the Students Union Government.
Consequently, the management also banned all SUG activities in school until further notice.
The students’ body had accused the school’s management of plotting to install a stooge, who would do the management’s bidding as their leader.
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the protest by the students disrupted normal academic activities and vehicular movement in and out of the school.
Some valuable facilities in the institution’s School of Engineering were also destroyed.
The institution’s Director of Protocol, Information and Public Relations, Adeyemi Adejolu, in a statement issued in Ado Ekiti on Sunday, denied the students’ claims that authorities were interfering with the union’s affairs.
He also described as needless and unwarranted the violent protest by the students, saying their action was based on mere rumour from unreliable sources, adding that the school’s management had nothing to gain from imposing candidates in students’ union election.
According to him, the decision to shut the polytechnic was arrived at during an emergency joint meeting of the Academic Board and Management Committee held on Saturday.
For Femi Falana and Kunle Ajibade: Sixty Hurrahs to Courage and Conviction By Ogaga Ifowodo
These two tribunes of truth and justice recently marked their sixtieth anniversary in a beautiful land made almost unliveable on any proper index of healthy living, where the average life expectancy is a bleak fifty-four years, placing us behind 215 other countries in the world and 15 in Africa. They can’t hear me, but I am shouting sixty hurrays in the first instance, and sixty more (for I wish them a very long life), in tribute to their extraordinary courage.
Dr. Ogaga Ifowodo
I was twenty-three and in the first semester of my final year as a law student at the University of Benin. He was thirty and already a rising star in the legal profession, though still under the wing of the urbane but ever battle-ready Alao Aka-Bashorun. I had recently ceased to be Secretary-General of the Students Union and Opeyemi Bamidele (now literally taking the bullets of enemies of democracy in our land) newly sworn in as the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, pending the election to constitute a new executive. And it was the matter of the election that led to my “indefinite suspension” — along with Bamidele and two others, in the first instance (eight more followed suit, besides the president of the union) — thereby almost confirming my father’s fear the day I informed him of my intention to run for a Students Union office: that I did not intend to graduate!
Still smarting from our victory in the fight for the restoration of the union at Uniben — following the unconstitutional ban on student union activities in the wake of the nationwide protests sparked by the murder of four Ahmadu Bello University students by anti-riot policemen precipitately called to quell a peaceful protest (Professor Ango Abdullahi, the vice chancellor, would further outrage the nation by announcing that “only four students died” as if one were not too many) — Professor Grace Alele-Williams sought to pacify her campus for General Babangida, the reigning military dictator, by issuing intolerable election guidelines. Candidates were to submit their manifestoes for vetting; were not to use university policy as a campaign issue; must not belong to campus associations (this aimed at disqualifying members of the “banned” League of Patriotic Students, resurrected as the Cultural Awareness Club, our group); possession of a minimum Grade Point Average of 2.75; and disqualification without reason. Why call it an election, you might ask, but we were then in the early years of Babangida’s political witchcraft, hence his dying need to pacify the campuses by emasculating the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), as well as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), arguably the only organised opposition at the time to the burgeoning military terror. Our suspension was punishment for rallying the students against the obnoxious guidelines, for calling “on students to boycott” the elections and — of course, they had to add this — “incit[ing] them to violence and demonstration.”
But that was hardly our only crime. At the time of the second petrol price increase by Babangida from 39.5 kobo to 42 kobo per litre — yes, the national currency did have value once upon a time! — the union had barely been inaugurated and so we lacked the platform for an effective protest, with the University of Jos, I believe, leading the way then. Then Babangida gave us a chance to salve our festering wound of non-participation: the students unions of the universities that shunned “violence” by not protesting would each be given an eighteen-seater bus to commend their “maturity.” Promptly, we made clear what kind of praise or gifts the University of Benin union would accept by holding a rally and rejecting the bribe outright. But the true test of the union’s character followed quickly when the university decided to cancel resit examinations. Resits gave a second chance, a lifeline even, to struggling students, many of whom were indigent, some constrained to do menial work in town to see themselves through school, and who still had to cope with poor living conditions, and non-existent or inadequate learning materials as libraries and laboratories were sapped to “death” by the IMF/World Bank’s Structural Adjustment Programme, imposed by Babangida on the nation despite its total rejection by the people. Whatever the merits of the decision, the students would accept it only if living and learning conditions were improved, even if by a mere fifty percent. The vice-chancellor would not budge and challenged me, as the perceived recalcitrant mouthpiece of the students, to a debate. The entire university trooped to the quadrangle of the Faculty of Social Sciences to be schooled on how misguided the new students union was. As it happened, she lost the argument and was constrained to restore resit exams for the time being. That was the last straw. Something had to be done.
And so disregarding our request to examine the evidence and witnesses against us, and for adequate time to prepare our response to the charges of holding a rally, and incitement to demonstration and violence, the university proceeded at break-neck speed to hand us what, in effect, were expulsion letters. I took the query, our responses, and the suspension letters to Femi Falana in Lagos, meeting him at home in Ketu where he lived at the time. On the principle of fair hearing alone, our suspension would be annulled by the court, but what to do about the ubiquitous cast-iron ouster clauses in the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree, the Federal Military Government (Supremacy and Enforcement of Powers) Decree, recently reiterated in the Students Union Activities (Control and Regulation) Decree 47? Falana saw a way out. He would bring to aid the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, already ratified and domesticated, which, as an international treaty, Nigeria was obligated to enforce in her courts. By sheer coincidence, the late Justice James Omo-Agege of the former Bendel State High Court was assigned the case, Bamidele & Ors v The University of Benin. He had been one of the resource persons who helped birth the Charter during his time as an expatriate jurist in The Gambia. He was more than happy to give it life, though the university’s failure to adhere to its enabling Act had already simplified the task for him. He voided our suspension/expulsion. I lost a semester but returned to complete my LL.B with honours, though Professor Alele-Williams would withhold my faculty reference form and prevent my admission into the Nigeria Law School until a month before the bar exam, the battle for my admission waged administratively this time by Mr Aka-Bashorun himself.
He was thirty and I was twenty-three when we first met. I, a law student with his head in law and his heart in poetry and literature, and he a copy writer with the defunct Grant Advertising at an indifferent address on Bode Thomas Street, Surulere, Lagos. Kunle Ajibade, would soon after wend his way to the newsrooms of The Guardian, The African Concord, and TheNEWS magazine and Tempo newspaper, the last two as co-founder and editor. I don’t recall precisely the occasion of our first meeting — whether the 1988 Association of Nigerian Authors annual conference at the National Theatre or on one of my many truant jaunts to Lagos to attend this or that reading — but whichever it was, I suspect that I was introduced by the late poet Idzia Ahmad, Ajibade’s colleague at Grant. It was in his days at The African Concord, however, that I really got to know Ajibade. With the encouragement of Lewis Obi, its editor, and Ohi Alegbe, copy editor, I had begun contributing articles to its pages. And then in 1993 I won the Association of Nigerian Authors poetry prize with an unpublished manuscript, what became Homeland and Other Poems. Ajibade who had begun a series of long interviews of established authors for Weekend Concord, was, it seemed, almost as delighted as my euphoric self and interviewed me for his report as if I were already a bona fide poet, thereby doing wonders for my budding writer’s ego!
But literature is one thing and real life another. And so it was that soon after that we would both be in the trenches during the vicious days of the Babangida/Abacha tyranny that culminated in the cruellest evil perpetrated against democracy and our sovereign right to self-determination: the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election. Jailed for life, he was, by a military tribunal set up to confirm verdicts already reached before the charges were framed. Ajibade’s offence had been no more than publishing General Obasanjo’s statement in denial of the ridiculous charge of accessory before the fact of treason, making Ajibade’s offence purportedly that of being an accessory after the fact of treason! Whenever anyone quite solicitously wondered how I coped with six months of preventive detention, I always said that I got away lightly and would cite Ajibade among other human rights and democracy activists given life imprisonment sentences, or who had spent well over a year in the Babangida/Abacha gulag, Ajibade having done three-and-a-half years before freedom came in the wake of his jailer’s death. I was amused when Ngugi wa Thiong’o conceded to Ajibade the status of “older jailbird” during a conversation with him at the 2016 Ake Arts and Book festival in Abeokuta because he had himself spent only one year in Arap Moi’s prison.
Jailed for life, but the people on whose side he fought, as the rest of the world, hailed him for a life courageously lived. As they hail Falana who in those days walked through revolving doors to prison cells and SSS dungeons. Among his peers and even succeeding generations, Falana stands tall as a people’s solicitor and advocate, insisting on seeing law as a tool of social engineering rather than merely as a genteel profession of self-satisfied practitioners, best served without a conscience, by keeping silent in the face of tyranny or, even better, taking the side of diabolical governments. For his part, Ajibade was editor of Tempo, the underground newspaper set up by TheNEWS crew after their magazine had been proscribed. These two tribunes of truth and justice recently marked their sixtieth anniversary in a beautiful land made almost unliveable on any proper index of healthy living, where the average life expectancy is a bleak fifty-four years, placing us behind 215 other countries in the world and 15 in Africa. They can’t hear me, but I am shouting sixty hurrays in the first instance, and sixty more (for I wish them a very long life), in tribute to their extraordinary courage.

FG Should Stop Subjecting Sowore To Media Trial By Femi Falana
The SSS also claimed in a sworn affidavit that Sowore had travelled to Dubai to collect millions of dollars to overthrow the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. But when the SSS later found that Sowore had never travelled to Dubai or any part of the United Arab Emirates, the monstrous allegation was jettisoned.
Photo Speaks: Omoyele Sowore's Timeline
SaharaReporters Media
When Mr Omoyele Sowore was arrested on August 3 , 2019, the State Security Service accused him of engaging in terrorist activities. On the basis of the allegation, the SSS obtained an order from the Honourable Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja to detain Sowore for 45 days in order to investigate his alleged terrorist activities. But at the end of the investigation, he was not linked to terrorism in any way. Hence, he was not charged with any offence under the Terrorism Prevention Act, 2011 as amended.
The SSS also claimed in a sworn affidavit that Sowore had travelled to Dubai to collect millions of dollars to overthrow the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. But when the SSS later found that Sowore had never travelled to Dubai or any part of the United Arab Emirates, the monstrous allegation was jettisoned.
Even though the allegations of terrorism and treasonable felony against Sowore had collapsed like a pack of cards, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN), engaged in a face-saving measure by charging him and Olawale Bakare with treasonable felony for planning to organise public protests against the Buhari administration. Not sure that the charge of treasonable felony would succeed in the court, the AGF proceeded to charge Sowore with cyberstalking for allegedly insulting President Buhari in a television interview and money laundering.
Meanwhile, the organisers of the public protests, which were held in Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River and Osun states were charged with unlawful assembly. The case filed in Ogun State has been dismissed while the defendants have been discharged following the no case submission of the defence counsel, Mr. Effiong Inibehe. The defendants in the other cases have been granted bail pending trial by the various magistrate courts. Having met the bail conditions they have regained their freedom.
But the orders of Justice Taiwo and Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu for the release of Sowore and Bakare were ignored with impunity by the SSS. Although the SSS complied with the court order for the release of Sowore and Bakare within 24 hours' ultimatum, its operatives turned round to manhandle Sowore in the well of the court and later rearested him without any warrant of arrest.
However, because of the gravity of the charge pending at the Federal High Court, the presiding Judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had ordered the prosecutor to make available to the defendants the statements of all prosecution witnesses while the case was fixed for definite hearing on the 5th and 6th, December, 2019.
But on account of the refusal of the SSS to comply with the order of Justice Ojukwu for the release of Sowore and Bakare on bail, the defendants were unable to prepare their case. As the SSS refused to comply with the order of court to produce the statements of the prosecution witnesses the case has been further adjourned to February 20, 2020 at the instance of the prosecution counsel. For wasting the precious time of the trial court, the prosecutor was ordered to pay N100,000 to the defendants in accordance with section 296 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015. The prosecutor has since paid the said cost.
It is therefore embarrassing that the Federal Government which has found it difficult to prove its case in a competent court of law has resorted to the media trial of Sowore. Thus, in a press statement on Sunday, December 8, 2019, a presidential spokesperson, Mr Garba Shehu claimed that “Sowore called for a revolution to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nigeria.”
In comparing Sowore with the Boko Haram sect, the Presidency said, “Nigeria is already dealing with an insurgency that has left millions of people displaced and desperate in the North-East region of country. The Boko Haram militants, who are behind the violence, also fancy themselves to be fighting for some sort of revolution.” The link is a justification for the planned arraignment of Sowore for terrorism.
Since it is common knowledge that Sowore and Bakare are not among the well known merchants of violence and coup plotters that had successfully but illegally removed democratically elected governments in Nigeria, we are not going to join issues with Mr Shehu over the highly contemptuous statements credited to him. But as a senior journalist, Mr Shehu ought to have known that it is highly unprofessional to subject a man held incommunicado to scurrilous attacks in the media. We are however, convinced that Sowore will have a right of reply once the fundamental rights of the Nigerian people are restored.
Even though the Federal Government has failed to engage in the diligent prosecution of the serious case, the Presidency has resorted to media trial while the charge of treasonable felony is allowed to hang menacingly on the heads of our clients. We are however, not going to be tempted to join issues with the Presidency over a case that is pending before a properly constituted court of law. If the Presidency is so sure that our clients committed treasonable felony or any other offence whatsoever, it should keep its powder dry and advise the prosecution to commence the trial without any further delay.
Fire Burns 12 Corpses Inside Obafemi Awolowo University Morgue
She said no life was lost to the incident but about 12 corpses kept in the cabin inside the morgue were affected.
About 12 corpses were on Tuesday burnt in an early morning fire that razed the morgue of Anatomy Department of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State, according to a report by PUNCH.
Spokesperson for the Osun Police Command, Folasade Odoro, confirmed the incident.
She said no life was lost to the incident but about 12 corpses kept in the cabin inside the morgue were affected.
Odoro added that the detectives from the command were already investigating the cause of the incident.
Public Relations Officer of the university, Abiodun Olanrewaju, in a statement said about 102 bodies were kept in the morgue when the fire caused by power surge started around 3:00am on Tuesday.
He said, “The fire, which broke out at 3:00am today (Tuesday, November 19, 2019) was caused by electricity surge which affected a section of the morgue where corpses are kept.
“Out of about 102 bodies kept in the morgue, 12 were affected by the fire outbreak.
“The department has made detailed arrangements to duly and adequately inform those who have kept bodies (corpses) in the morgue.”
Five Lessons Learnt From Anthony Joshua’s Comeback Victory By Samuel Osho
Our fears are as strong as the belief we put in them. Joshua stepped into the ring and used his fears to his advantage; he faced his demons and punched them until they got exhausted.
The suspense in the misty air of Diriyah Arena turned to an atmosphere of celebration as Nigerian-born British heavyweight boxer, Anthony Joshua, reclaims his titles. Joshua’s tense rematch with Andy Ruiz remains one of the most significant moments in 2019 for the world of boxing.
Andy Ruiz stunned the world six months ago at the Madison Square Garden in New York after a big upset that ended in a technical knockout. Ruiz, an underdog, knocked Joshua to the canvass four times before the referee stopped the fight in the seventh round after a flurry of punches. On that night, Ruiz made history as the first boxer of Mexican descent to become a heavyweight title winner.
In Saturday night’s rematch, the world saw a different Anthony Joshua with rare mettle and prowess required for success in the boxing ring. His athleticism, technicalities, and sportsmanship were on display as the world stood still to watch a resilient fighter reclaim his lost titles. It was an emotional moment for Joshua, who had a sweet return to the number one spot in the heavyweight boxing division. He won in style and became a two-time world heavyweight champion with a unanimous victory over Andy Ruiz.
During the build-up to the match, there were fears if Joshua had the mental fortitude to fight his demons and go for a win. On Saturday, he reassured his teeming fans and answered lots of questions. Those answers came with quick jabs, timely hooks, and calculated movements, all delivered in a 36 minutes show of clinical finish.
With the comeback victory, Joshua joined Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Floyd Patterson and Mike Tyson in the league of men to have reclaimed the world heavyweight title. In this historical moment, there are lessons to learn from a man that came back from the dead to knock out the same person that gifted him his first career defeat.
Fela Kuti lives on
Ahead of his much-anticipated fight with Ruiz in Saudi Arabia, Joshua paid homage to his Nigerian roots. The British boxer with Nigerian parents chose a tune by Nigerian multi-talented musician, Fela Kuti, as his entrance song.
The song, Water No Get Enemy by Fela, a trailblazer of Afrobeat music and a fearless human rights activist, was perfect for the occasion and a precursor for a historic night. During Joshua’s visit to Nigeria in July, he stopped by at Fela’s shrine in Lagos, where Femi Kuti showed him around. This victorious match reminded everyone of Fela’s undying legacy.
Stay hungry for a win
There are no friends in the ring, and the best way to come out of the ring victorious is by inflicting damage on the opponent. In the first match in New York, it was apparent that Joshua lacked the hunger needed for victory. After hitting the canvas in the third round, Joshua appeared lost and uncoordinated; he struggled through the remaining rounds before the referee waved the fight off.
In the rematch, it was evident that Joshua was hungry for a victory. He was there to prove a point and retrieve his lost belts that were on exile in California. The hunger reflected in the superb head and body movement aimed at dodging Ruiz’s punches. If there were anything Joshua learned after his defeat, it would be to stay hungry in the face of any opposition.
Stick to the game plan
Before his first match with Ruiz, everyone was used to Joshua decapitating his opponents before the final round with an exception for the bout with Joseph Parker. For many of the fans, they wanted to see an angry Joshua in the ring with a shower of punches to revenge his humiliating loss in June. It was not a big ask from a man that has 21 knockouts out of 22 professional wins. Let the “champ” do the magic again. While that seems like a brilliant plan that could drive the fans wild, it would have placed Joshua in a vulnerable position resulting in a second defeat. It would have been a blatant display power without tactfulness.
It is quite understandable if the critics wanted a spectacular match, but often, the key to victory is taking calculated risks and not doing what everyone expects. Joshua understood the difference between showmanship and professionalism. He took the stance of a professional pugilist and displayed a tactical understanding of the sport to wear out his opponent.
Boxing is all about taking well-timed punches and avoid getting hit. That was the game plan, and a disciplined Joshua stuck to the plan from start to finish. Joshua never allowed Ruiz to lock him a close range that is advantageous to a speedy boxer like Ruiz. He made use of his long legs by pacing in the ring, which not only frustrated his opponent but prevented Ruiz from landing his punches in a close range. Those powerful jabs courtesy of Joshua’s long-range paid off in the match against his Mexican rival. Joshua practically animated Mohammed Ali’s words, “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. The hands can’t hit what the eyes can’t see.”
Stay focused on the prize
On the road to success, the focus is paramount. In the build-up to the rematch, Joshua was under immense pressure, and he could not afford a second defeat. In the ring, it’s hard to stay focused on a plan after suffering a devastating hit. However, it pays to stay focused and avoid any unexpected complications from surprise hooks. Before the rematch, Joshua was hard on himself with a laser-focused training regimen. He trimmed his weight to 237 pounds, his lowest in five years (lost 10 pounds in six months). It takes focus and discipline to do that.
In sharp contrast to Joshua’s approach, Andy Ruiz added 16 pounds to his chubby frame, which impacted his movement in the ring. It’s hard to keep up with six months of uninterrupted media attention and sudden fame.Bouncing back from an embarrassing loss is hard. But Joshua forgot about the mixed feelings of the past and focused on the next 36 minutes of his life in the ring – the moment that decides what happens next in his boxing career. With eyes on the prize and a heart bent on winning, he earned his titles back amidst cheers and applause from a satisfied audience.
Punch your fears in the face
Preceding the match in New York, Joshua was an undefeated unified heavyweight champion. Although he had a close shave with defeat in his match against Wladimir Klitschko, he bounced back after a knockdown in the sixth round. His first taste of defeat in his professional career was against Ruiz in June, and he lost to an underdog that was unknown to anyone before the match.
The fears of losing again must have haunted Joshua in the past few months, but his fighting spirit during the rematch showed the traits of a champion. Former heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, once said, “Fear is just like fire; it can be helpful if you know how to use it. If not, you will get burned.”
Our fears are as strong as the belief we put in them. Joshua stepped into the ring and used his fears to his advantage; he faced his demons and punched them until they got exhausted.

FLASHBACK: Undercover Investigation: With Just N70, You Can Buy A Pirated Copy Of Genevieve's 'Lionheart'
Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first ever submission for best international feature Oscar consideration, “Lionheart” has been disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences saying it had too much English dialogue.
An undercover investigation by Sahara Reporters in January this year had revealed that the movie whose right was exclusively bought by online streaming platform, Netflix was been pirated in Alaba Markets, Lagos and sold for just N70.
In October, wild reactions trailed the selection of “Lionheart” by the Nigerian Oscars Selection Committee, NOSC, to represent Nollywood at the 2020 Oscars as there was varying reactions and argument as why the movie should have or not have been selected.
Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first ever submission for best international feature Oscar consideration, “Lionheart” has been disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences saying it had too much English dialogue.

#FreeSowore: Chaining A Body Whose Mind Is Free By Modiu Olaguro
The government arrested Sowore in body thinking they could get a hold of his soul. Those championing #FreeSowore should at least be consoled that no one on earth has the capacity to chain a body whose mind is free.
Modiu Olaguro
Sahara Reporters Media
“The young generation of whites, blacks, browns, whatever else there is, you’re living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there’s got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change. And a better world has to be built and the only way it’s going to be built is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will join in with anyone—don’t care what colour you are—as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.”—Malcolm X at the Oxford Union in December, 1964.
A couple of weeks after the 2019 presidential elections, I met Omoyele Sowore at the Sahara Reporters’ Civic Media Lab and after we exchanged pleasantries in his usual "hey professor" way, he told me in a sombre tone how travelling across Nigeria during his one year intensive campaigns had made him (upon his brief return to the United States) value things he had hitherto taken for granted having been practically away for twenty years.
Sowore told me how he came to appreciate the leaders of America for the good roads, stable power, modern schools, world-class health care, mortgage facilities, welfare programs, etcetera.
I listened to him with rapt attention and pity as he held the stand of the red water tank inside the compound. When he was done talking, I said the following words:
Sir, please leave us here with our poverty and return to the states.
Unknown to many, Sowore is rich and comfortable. His children neither live nor school here. If I had a twelfth of the opportunity Sowore has, I would have forgotten the location of Nigeria on the world map. I am writing this as clear as I can with a heavy heart. Nigerians who are most hit by poverty and hunger have shown the most love to those inflicting those indignities on them.
Although, a friend of his warned that he could dislike me for asking that he leave Nigerians with their poverty, I had to say it nonetheless. I do not know what could motivate someone as comfortable as ‘Sho’ to leave his family, job and convenience to fight against base conditions that ordinarily have little effect on him.
Nigeria is a space of dead people. It is a dangerous black hole where no amount of good manifests as a result of its nature of neutralizing anything worthwhile thrown at it.
The same people castigating Sowore are dying in hunger, writhing in pain and smiling in agony; yet clutch in vain hope, struggling to take a seat on the podium where praises are heaped on the custodians of their chains.
How will a country led by established thieves, certificate forgers and freeloaders appreciate a person like Sowore who created something out of nothing? How did Nigeria treat Professors Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Pius Adesanmi and Ayodele Awojobi? Did Awojobi, a genius professor of engineering not threaten to go study law? Did the Nigerian government not frustrate him that he once broke down in tears in court?
If I had an herbalist, I will not think twice before taking Sowore's name there and cause him to forget the name of his country. For thirty years since he found his voice, Nigeria has chained, arrested and molested him. Until two years ago when he overcame the fear of death, he used to sneak in and out of the country. As it stands, the day I leave this country will be the last I will complain about it. The argument that there is no place like home holds water when there is one to begin with. How has Nigeria been made home for Nigerians? Did the president not say the southeast was not a part of his constituency?
Daily, we live in fear. Fear of insecurity. Fear of devaluation of a weak currency. Fear of war. Fear of an increase in the pump-price of petrol. Fear of a social uprising. Fear of everything. Anyone resident here with no fear in his/her heart is either dead or delusional. The reality is that this country will not get better anytime soon—not with the ruinous path her wicked handlers have intentionally put her. The thought that the rest of the world left us in the 17th century to move to the 21st is enough to prove my point. Look around you: from the roads politicians build to the rail, from agriculture to education, and from our hospitals back to our governance system, can you spot a difference between them and those that have been around since the time of Isaac Newton?
Unlike many, Omoyele Sowore is a firm believer in Nigeria and Nigerians. In July when he met with Nnamdi Kanu, one of the things he told him was his aversion to the snide remarks members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) make against members of other ethnic stock in Nigeria.
Sowore told him everyone outside of the political class is suffering a form of injustice or the other and efforts must be made to speak for all and not to call for the balkanization of the Lugardian Contraption. Sowore's vision is to have a borderless African continent in the way and manner our Pan-Africanist ancestor, Kwame Nkrumah envisaged.
His positions are on the internet. Sowore does not and has never advocated for the dissolution of the country although he has a right to do so. His anger, like mine, rests solely on the criminal minds ruining this blessed land of milk and honey.
While it is within the rights of anyone to fault the methods and timing of his many interventions including the most recent, #RevolutionNow, what is unacceptable is his traducers’ penchant at distorting his motives and passion at seeing that this present order of blood and death is put to an end. A country peopled by individuals who fail to appreciate little things will find it unworthy to reckon with the heavy sacrifices a few persons from amongst them make.
Whether the despotic government of Muhammadu Buhari frees Sowore or not, I have no doubt that individuals averse to the rot in this society will keep up with the momentum as a means to end this condition of suffering and sin firmly in place in Nigeria .
What is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God’s own country.
In cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.
Even though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a “dump.”
The guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.
It doesn’t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the “C” average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America’s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Donald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.
The one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.
The Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to “make America great again,” as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.
Even though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.
My point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.
Ii is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.
If Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.
I seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.
Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.
George Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his “read my lips” pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.
I gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.
Republicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.
Republicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by “grabbing their pussies” because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.
Republicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.
Republicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.
They elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman’s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.
Republicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.
The list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as “fake news” disseminators.
He has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.
What atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.
It is a complete outrage and totally incredible!
I rest my case.

There's Still Time To Change, Group Tells Buhari
He also condemned the President on the handling of Omoyele Sowore’s case, advising Buhari to take his government back from “many unelected characters currently ruling the country by proxy”.
Voice of Reason, a group of Yoruba professionals, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to turn a new leaf from his current anti-democracy dispositions.
Chairman of the group, Olufemi Adegoke, said this during a press briefing on Thursday.
He also condemned the President on the handling of Omoyele Sowore’s case, advising Buhari to take his government back from “many unelected characters currently ruling the country by proxy”.
He said, “As keen observers of the goings-on in the polity, we state without any equivocation that the President needs to act urgently not only to restore his integrity and align his lofty rhetoric with his actions but to regenerate in Nigerians faith that it is possible to have leaders that can serve all without discrimination.
“The “born again democrat” garb lent to the President on the eve of 2015 election needs a lot of stitches to hang well on the wearer.
Democracy does not end with multi-party elections. It includes fairness, transparency and integrity of the electoral process; absolute respect for the rule of law; protection of the independence of the institutions of democracy (parliament and the judiciary).     “We urge the President to borrow a leaf from General Gowon and do that which will strengthen the unity of Nigeria by leading the fight to restructure Nigeria, renew citizens’ commitment to Nigeria, galvanise everybody’s energy to build a nation where no one is oppressed, show by example the need to reduce cost of governance, restore the rule of law, rededicate himself to defending democracy, protect all citizens’ human rights and deepen the fight against corruption.     “President Buhari needs deep reflection and his genuine friends need to help him focus on leaving an enviable legacy.     It is not too late. He has three years to go. We pray for the sake of Nigeria and his place in history he takes our admonition in good faith and acts.”
They Have Started Again By Richard Akinnola
There are certain irreducible minimums l can tolerate from people l call my friends. This is not about holding a contrary view but peddling falsehood to save face after such a despicable conduct of Friday.
Richard Akinnola
When Dele Giwa was assassinated on October 19, 1986, the major suspects were the two security operatives of the General Ibrahim Babangida junta. In an attempt to shift the focus from them, they procured some Nigerians to peddle false narratives, accusing Dele's wife and his colleagues as the main suspects.
Also in 1986, Alozie Ogugbuaja, then the Lagos spokesperson for police, ran into troubled waters over his accusations against the military government for not funding the police. He was suspended. Thereafter, the agents of the junta went after his life. A grenade was thrown from a moving vehicle at him but it refused to detonate. Instead of standing by their man, the police IG, Gambo, said the grenade was "harmless" and must have fallen from a moving vehicle. Ever heard of a harmless grenade! They always have odious lies to peddle.
In 1988, agents of Babangida junta set fire on Gani Fawehinmi's house at 28 Sabiu Ajose Crescent, Surulere, Lagos, housing his library and his second wife and her children. Guess what the police said? In an attempt to change the narrative of their dastardly action, they accused Gani Fawehinmi of setting his house on fire "in order to embarrass the government". A livid Fawehinmi countered the police - "You mean l would set fire on my house, housing my wife and children and books worth millions of naira just to embarrass a government that is already embarrassed? You must be insane like your useless government".
In 1996, after the assassination of Alhaja Kudirat Abiola by the agents of Abacha junta, the security agencies, also in an attempt to shift the accusations from them, arrested some NADECO chieftains, accused them of being behind the gruesome act till a court ordered their release. Of course, Nigerians knew that Abacha's Strike Force was behind the gruesome act.
Now, after the show of shame inside the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday, the perpetrators have equally procured some people to retail some puerile and jejune narrative that it was Omoyele Sowore and his team that simulated the scene in order to blackmail the security agency.
Unfortunately, one of my friends, Mallam Jaji, is part of those peddling this narrative. I have told him on his wall that with his position, l'm afraid of him. I can't feel comfortable being friends with people like this.
In fact, l would have to unfriend him. It's as serious as that. We are not just Facebook friends, we are friends in real life. But not anymore. There are certain irreducible minimums l can tolerate from people l call my friends. This is not about holding a contrary view but peddling falsehood to save face after such a despicable conduct of Friday.
You can go ahead to continue retailing your false narrative in order to mask an obvious fact but l also reserve the right to distance myself from such "friends". I'm not emotional about severing relationship with such people. As l often posit, this issue is not about Sowore as a person but about principle.
Thugs Shoot Two Children In Edo During Political Rally
The thugs shot sporadically into the air to scare away loyalists heading to Osagie Ize-Iyamu's house for the All Progressives Congress rally at Etete, GRA, Benin.
Two teenage boys in Edo State were hit by stray bullets on Friday morning as thugs invaded the city during a political rally.
The thugs shot sporadically into the air to scare away loyalists heading to Osagie Ize-Iyamu's house for the All Progressives Congress rally at Etete, GRA, Benin.
The two kids, Ovbiagele Ohimai and Joshua Samuel, who are seven and 11 respectively, were sent on an errand by their parents when they were hit by stray bullets.
They are receiving treatment in an undisclosed private hospital in Benin presently.
Many of Ize-Iyamu's loyalists, who were conveyed from the 18 local government areas of the state, sustained various degrees of bullet wounds as a result of the incident.
Tinubu All Smiles As Sanwo-Olu Receives Certificate Of Return
“Our resolve to lead the state as Governor and Deputy Governor is not about our personal welfare and that of our families, but a determination to build a state that all of us will be proud of," Sanwo-Olu said. "We will not disappoint Lagosians for the confidence reposed in us to lead on their behalf. We promise to lead a government that will be responsible and that will work for the greater majority of residents."
Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the most notable name in attendance as Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State Governor-Elect, and his running mate Obafemi Hamzat received their certificates of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at a ceremony held at the commission’s office in Yaba, Lagos Mainland, on Friday.
Clad in Agbada with caps to match, the Governor-elect and his deputy were accompanied to the carnival-like event by their wives, associates, family members and APC leaders, including the party chairman in Lagos, Hon. Tunde Balogun; party leader, Prince Tajudeen Olusi; and former Minister of State for Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, among others.
At exactly 11:30am, INEC National Commissioner in charge of Lagos, Ondo and Ogun states, Dr. Adekunle Ogunmola, presented the certificate to Sanwo-Olu, charging the Governor-Elect to be magnanimous in victory. Sanwo-Olu received the certificate in company of his wife, Ibijoke.
Ogunmola charged Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat to pursue reconciliation and close ranks with their opponents, reminding them that tolerance of opposition remains a key foundation of constitutional democracy.
The state’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Sam Olumekun, described Sanwo-Olu’s victory as rancour-free, noting that international observers adjudged the Lagos governorship election to be free, fair and credible.
Pointing out that 45 political parties fielded governorship candidates in the election, Olumekun, however, lamented apathy among voters in some constituencies. He particularly made a reference to Eti-Osa Constituency 1, which recorded a four per cent voter turnout — a development he described as unprecedented.
In his six-minute acceptance speech, Sanwo-Olu promised to lead “an all-inclusive government”, while extending a hand of fellowship to his opponents in the governorship race. He expressed joy that his victory was not tainted by violence and bloodshed.
He specially paid tribute to President Muhammadu Buhar and Tinubu for displaying “responsible leadership”, which “led to victory of APC in Lagos and the centre”.
He said: “Our resolve to lead the state as Governor and Deputy Governor is not about our personal welfare and that of our families, but a determination to build a state that all of us will be proud of. We will not disappoint Lagosians for the confidence reposed in us to lead on their behalf. We promise to lead a government that will be responsible and that will work for the greater majority of residents.
“Whatever happened during the campaign period belongs to the past. It’s time for reconciliation and the state must move forward. Therefore, we will not engage anyone or group based on their political affiliation, ethnic nationality or whether they voted for us or not, we are all Lagosians and we will run a government that will work for all.”

Trader Sues Saraki, Atiku For Portraying Her In Campaign Poster
She said her picture was taken without her consent and put to pubic use where she was portrayed like she was deprived and less privileged.
Amuda Adeleke, a trader in Victoria Island, Lagos, has sued Bukola Saraki, a former Senate President, who was also Director-General of the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation for the 2019 general election, for portraying her in a poster as poor.
Adeleke also joined in the suit Abukabar, his running mate, Peter Obi and the Peoples Democratic Party.
She said her picture was taken without her consent and put to pubic use where she was portrayed like she was deprived and less privileged.
The suit, which was filed before the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, is praying the court to award N45m damages to the plaintiff for the unauthorised and unlawful use of her photographs.
She explained through the court papers that Saraki and his campaign crew had come to Victoria Island during the election to canvass for votes, adding that she was not aware that the photographs taken would become a part of PDP’s campaign souvenir
She said she was shocked when she started receiving phone calls from relatives and friends, who had seen the campaign billboards on which her photo was displayed.
However, Saraki and the other respondent sdenied that they had any contact with the woman.
The respondents argued that their campaign materials were managed by a third party, and that the company sought her consent and interviewed her before using her pictures.
The respondents said she had given her name as Tope Olukolu.
They also claimed she was paid before her photographs were used.
The court has now adjourned the case to January 2020 for the continuation of hearing.

Trump's Trial Or Triumph? By Hannatu Musawa
The latest Ukraine scandal was triggered by President Trump’s alleged efforts to coerce Ukraine and other countries to provide damaging information about the 2020 Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden. President Trump was said to have pressured his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General, Bill Barr and other parties outside his administration to influence politics in Washington. The 2016 Presidential election scandal also has not disappeared.
Hannatu Musawa
A near impossible and rare feat is to impeach a United States' president. The president must have committed, either bribery, treason or other serious crimes or misdemeanors. Even at that, in the present clime, it is almost impossible to believe that the Republican members of Congress in the Senate would pass such a bill if presented with one by the lower House of Representatives.
After the American civil war and President Abraham Lincoln’s death, his Vice President, Andrew Johnson became the 17th president of the US, Johnson, had radical ideas and constantly was at loggerheads with the Congress by vetoing certain bills.
In 1867 when he replaced the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, a man appointed by Lincoln who supported the Radical Republicans, a breakaway group of the party who believed in the civil rights of freed African Americans, Congress pushed hard and presented eleven articles of impeachment alleging that President Johnson had violated what is known as the “Tenure of Office Act”, that is, a law meant to limit presidential power to remove federal appointees from office without consulting the Senate.
Eventually, in 1868, President Johnson was successfully impeached by a two- thirds majority of the House. This act was deemed unconstitutional years later by the Supreme Court. President Johnson was not removed from office because a single vote from seven Republicans who voted with the Democrats saved his position.
A Historian, Hans L. Trefousse wrote, “The weakness of the case convinced many that the charges were largely political and that the violation of the Tenure of Office Act constituted neither a crime nor a violation of the Constitution but merely a pretext for Johnson’s opponents.”
Interestingly, this historic case set the tone in Washington for future Presidential impeachments to follow, namely that no President should ever be impeached for political reasons but should be impeached for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors” as clearly stated by the U.S. Constitution.
Using the same paintbrush of which hunting for political reasons, the White House has repeatedly dismissed claims by the Democrats that top government officials had pressured leaders of other nations, namely Ukraine, to investigate the former U.S. Vice President and 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the personal and political interest of President Trump. President Trump has been quoted publicly as bragging that the Democrats have “no grounds to impeach.” He claims he has done “nothing wrong or illegal” in light of the formal impeachment proceedings against him recently.
In 1972, when the Watergate scandal broke, the 37th president of the US, Richard, Nixon struggled to cover up his direct involvement in the burgling and trespassing of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington. The scandal was intertwined with multiple cases of abuse of power of officials of the Nixon administration, which culminated in the commencement of an impeachment process against him. Apart from the overwhelming evidence of cash found on the five burglars of the DNC headquarters leading back to Nixon’s Staff, the investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape recording system in his offices where private conversations were recorded.
After grueling court battles, the Supreme Court ruled that the President was obligated to release the infamous tapes to government investigators. The tapes bore damning evidence that President Nixon was irrefutably involved in the break-in of the DNC office and abuse of power to cover up the investigation. In light of a predictable impeachment, on 9 August 1974, Nixon resigned his turbulent presidency. “Watergate” the name became synonymous with political or public scandal not just in the United States but globally as well.
On October 8, 1998, the United States House of Representatives commenced impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the U.S. under the accusation of “high crimes and misdemeanors". The reasons were for lying under oath and obstruction of justice tied to the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by a woman named Paula Jones. This would be the second time an American president would be impeached where the House formally adopted the articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the Senate for adjudication.
I remember vividly the frenzy by paparazzi when the proceedings of impeachment began in January 1999 with the Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding. After sensational interviews and depositions, President Bill Clinton was acquitted on February 12, 1999, on both counts of high crimes and misdemeanors as neither charges received the necessary two- thirds majority vote of the Senators present for conviction and removal from office. President Bill Clinton remained in office for the rest of his second term.
In a whirlwind twist and amidst probably one of the most surprising outcomes of a U.S. Presidential election held on 8 November 2016, Donald Trump defeated the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and became the 45th president of the United States. This was a massive blow to the Democrats who had fought a long and grueling campaign riddled with maliciousness and allegations of the infamous email messages that were deleted by Hillary Clinton’s team whilst she was in office.
Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes compared to 227 votes for Hillary Clinton despite pre-election nationwide polls that predicted she would win. Globally women had been excited as her victory would have been a symbol of gender equality with a female being the leader of the free world, the great United States of America, land of dreams. It was a bitter defeat for billions all over the world.
Almost immediately, President Trump’s presidency was riddled in controversies, accusations, and scandals amidst a chaotic White House. One could say that ultimately Hillary Clinton may have had the last laugh after all. The White House Staff were either dismissed or they quit by themselves and replaced on a regular basis, even the press struggled to keep up with the changes. A massive scandal subsequently broke out alleging that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election and the President took great pains to undermine the investigation.
It posed a threat to national security and made a mockery of the American voting system. The Russia scandal, the firing of James Comey (former FBI Director), resignation of Michael Flynn (former national adviser) and many more obstacles in his administration proved this to be the most troubled presidency in modern history. All this was happening amidst a barrage of regular tweets from the President on his official account on social media, which most see as unbecoming and entirely inappropriate for a President in office.
The latest Ukraine scandal was triggered by President Trump’s alleged efforts to coerce Ukraine and other countries to provide damaging information about the 2020 Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden. President Trump was said to have pressured his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General, Bill Barr and other parties outside his administration to influence politics in Washington. The 2016 Presidential election scandal also has not disappeared.
In the middle of September 2019, Trump's misuse of power to solicit foreign electoral intervention in the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign came into the full glare of the public because of a whistleblower statement made in August 2019. Then on 24 September 2019, the House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry led by six House Committees and the House voted to approve guidelines for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry on 31 October 2019.
To impeach President Trump, a majority is required in the House and for conviction or removal from office a two- thirds “super majority” is required in the senate.
The whole world waits and watches the outcome of the impeachment as they also wonder whether President Trump who could so aptly be described as the cat with nine lives (having emerged seemingly unscathed by each scandal) would survive the latest misconduct.
The question remains: Will this be Trump's triumph or trial? We only have a short while left to see as the political games in the United States continue to unravel.

Turkish Airlines Denies Suspension Of Operations In Nigeria
In reaction to the news circulating about the suspension of operations of Turkish Airlines in Nigeria by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, the airline has denied the report, branding it as false and misleading.
In reaction to the news circulating about the suspension of operations of Turkish Airlines in Nigeria by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, the airline has denied the report, branding it as false and misleading.
Turkish Airlines in a statement sent to SaharaReporters, said it continues to operate in all of its destinations in Nigeria, adding that the news was far from reality.
The airline said, “There are reports circulating in several news websites that claim Turkish Airlines operations in Nigeria are suspended or to be suspended by Nigeria Civil Aviation
Authority.
“We would like to announce that our operations continue in all of our destinations
in Nigeria.
The news reports on the subject do not reflect the reality.”     Turkish Airlines Deploys Bigger Aircraft To Nigerian Route After Passengers' Protest     NCAA had threatened to sack the airline from Nigeria if it continued to delay passengers’ check-in luggage on arrival at Lagos and Abuja airports.     Turkish Airlines has succumbed to threats by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority of being kicked out of the country by deploying bigger aircraft to Lagos and Abuja.     NCAA had threatened to sack the airline from Nigeria if it continued to delay passengers’ check-in luggage on arrival at Lagos and Abuja airports.     The airline has deployed a bigger aircraft, an Airbus 330 to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, rather than the previous Boeing 737 it used for the route.     The use of the B737, which is a smaller aircraft with a maximum capacity of 150 passengers, caused hardship to passengers whose luggage were consistently left behind in Istanbul, Turkey by the airline.     This forced some passengers to protest the non-arrival of their check-in luggage.     Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, confirmed the news on his official Twitter page.     He said, “Turkish Air operated A330 to Abuja today as against the small B737 in apparent response to our suspension order. We needed not to get to this,”     Turkish Airlines is allegedly notorious for its poor treatment of Nigerian travellers especially when they have to arrive their destinations without their checked-in luggage.     Two Dead In Lagos Building Collapse     The building, located at Number 9, Amosun Street, Ijora Badia, was said to have been an uncompleted building with nobody residing in it.     Two people have been confirmed dead in a three-storey building that collapsed in Lagos on Saturday.     The building, located at Number 9, Amosun Street, Ijora Badia, was said to have been an uncompleted building with nobody residing in it.     Confirming the accident, Adesina Tiamiyu, General Manager of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), stated that those who died were illegal residents, as they were in the building when it partially collapsed from the back.     He added that two of the residents were brought out dead from the debris, while the third person sustained some injuries.     LASEMA and other rescue agencies in Lagos were on ground to contain the situation.     Uduaghan, Ogboru Challenge Manager, Okowa As Delta Election Tribunal Receives 51 Petitions     Great Ogboru, the 2019 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Delta State, has also filed a petition challenging INEC's declaration of Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Delta State, as the winner of the March 9 governorship election.     Emmanuel Uduaghan, immediate past Governor of Delta State and Delta South senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congres, (APC), has filed a petition at the Delta State Election Petitions Tribunal against his opponent, James Manager of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), challenging his declaration by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as winner of the just concluded February, 23, 2019 National Assembly election.     In the same vein, Great Ogboru, the 2019 governorship candidate of the APC in the state, has also filed a petition challenging INEC's declaration of Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Delta State, as the winner of the March 9 governorship election. Ogboru had rejected the results of the election, alleging that the election was marred by rigging, voting buying, malpractices and snatching of ballots boxes by the PDP.     Also, Joel-Onowakpo Thomas, the APC House of Representatives candidate for Isoko federal constituency, filed a petition at the state tribunal challenging INEC’s declaration of Leo Ogor, the PDP candidate and incumbent House of Representatives minority leader, as winner of the February 23, 2019 National Assembly election in the area.     Speaking with journalists on Tuesday in Asaba, the Delta State capital, Ahmed Gusau, the Tribunal Secretary, confirmed that so far, a total of 51 petitions arising from the 2019 national assembly, governorship and state assembly elections had been received from various political parties candidates.     Also, Gusau disclosed that four petitions were filed for the senatorial election, two against Manager, one against Ovie Omo-Agege, the senator representing Delta Central on the platform of the APC, and one against Peter Nwaoboshi, the senator representing Delta North, on the PDP platform.     Gusau further disclosed that nine petitions were filed for the House of Representatives election, while 37 came from state assembly candidates against the winners of the election.     UK Receives £90bn Stolen Funds Yearly From Nigeria, Others –Experts     “The UK is a legally corrupt country,” Hildyard said, adding that if Western countries genuinely wish to fight corruption, they should stop the warehouse of stolen funds from Nigeria.     Bank of England     mobileinternetbanking.com     The United Kingdom receives not less than £90bn shady funds from Nigeria and other countries across the world every year, a team of foreign experts said in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, on Monday.     The experts said 87,000 illicit assets in UK are owned by anonymous companies in tax havens, while the values of secretly owned properties in the UK are between £56bn to £100bn.     Forty per cent of these properties are in the city of London, they affirmed.     The revelation was made by world acclaimed anti-corruption advocates, Christian Erikson and Lionel Faull, in a joint paper tagged Obtaining Property Information Overseas presented at the ongoing anti-corruption training organised by the Human and Environmental Development Agenda in collaboration with international groups.     The programme drew 70 civil society organisations, media, labour and representatives of anti-corruption institutions from across the Southern region of Nigeria.     In his remarks, Nick Hildyard, an anti-corruption investigator, said though the UK has one of the most effective anti-corruption laws, but that in reality the country does not appear to be fully prepared to stall the wave of corruption with her financial institutions providing the logistics for corrupt officials from Nigeria.     “The UK is a legally corrupt country,” Hildyard said, adding that if Western countries genuinely wish to fight corruption, they should stop the warehouse of stolen funds from Nigeria.     Faull said, “Getting your money back is easier said than done. It takes a long time.     “If you do not support corruption, there is no need doing banking with Nigeria.     “The fight against corruption will not succeed without a very active citizenry.     “It requires international solidarity, teaming up with civil society in order to work with international organisations and make authorities accountable.”     In his presentation, HEDA Chairman, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju, said about 456 top Nigerian public officials holding strategic positions are yet to declare their assets in spite of the regulations put in place by the Code of Conduct Bureau.     In her presentation, Prof Ayo Atsenuwa of the University of Lagos said that though the Freedom of Information law had opened fresh opportunities for Nigerians to hold their leaders accountable, Nigeria, unlike many other countries and jurisdictions, lacks a policy, guideline or law on public access of court documents.     UN, Amnesty International, Others Condemn Killing Of Aid Workers In Borno     The victims, who are members of the Action Against Hunger team working in the region, had been seized since July by the terror group.     Screen shot from the video showing the abducted aid workers     Punchng     The United Nations, Amnesty International, and Action Against Hunger have all condemned the killing of four humanitarian workers by members of the Islamic State West Africa Province in Borno State on Friday.     The victims, who are members of the Action Against Hunger team working in the region, had been seized since July by the terror group.     In a statement on Saturday, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr Edward Kallon, sympathised with the families of the slain workers.     He said, “I am deeply saddened and outraged by the news of the tragic killing of four aid workers who were held captive by armed groups for almost five months.     “My thoughts go to their families, friends and colleagues who are enduring unspeakable pain and hardship.”     Kallon however, called for the immediate release of Grace Taku, the member of the team still held by the insurgents.     While also condemning the killing, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria, Osai Ojigho, said, “With yet another horrific killing of humanitarian workers, Islamic State’s West Africa Province has again demonstrated its brazen disregard for life.     “The four slain aid workers were providing desperately-needed humanitarian services to people affected by the conflict in the North-East of Nigeria.     “The killing is a war crime. Under international humanitarian law, all aid workers must be protected from attack.     “ISWAP must immediately and unconditionally release the remaining aid workers.”     Calling for the release of other aid workers still in captivity, Action Against Hunger in a statement on Friday said, “Action Against Hunger extends its deepest sympathies to their loved ones and our colleagues in Nigeria.     “Action Against Hunger condemns these latest killings in the strongest terms and calls for the release of its staff member, Grace, who remains in captivity.     “Action Against Hunger states categorically that every attack against humanitarian workers ultimately impacts vulnerable civilians.”     UNILAG Shuts Room Lecturers Used To Give Marks For Sex     The so-called 'cold room' is a functions room that may have been abused because this is a deviation from the purpose for which it was created (meetings, seminars, events, etc.)     The University of Lagos has shut the ‘cold room’ lecturers were accused of using to sexually assault female students.The Principal Assistant Registrar (Communication Unit) of the university, Taiwo Oloyede, announced in a statement yesterday.“Management at its emergency meeting of October 7, 2019, suspended Dr. Igbeneghu from work immediately and barred him from the university academic areas while the suspension subsists unless invited by a panel constituted by the university to investigate the matter.“In addition to this, the university management has ordered the shut down of the Staff Club 'cold room' mentioned in the documentary for further investigation.

The University has a well-articulated “Policy on Sexual Harassment, Sexual and Romantic Relationships”.A copy of the University Sexual Harassment Policy was distributed to all members of staff and can also be obtained on the University website: https://unilag.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/SEXUAL-HARRASMENT-UNILAG-COMMUNICATION-UNITS.pdfVarious Committees over time have been set up to investigate reports received and those found guilty/culpable were sanctioned. To ensure our students are aware of the various opportunities for reporting any form of sexual harassment or misconduct towards them, the University organises an orientation programme for all new entrants sensitising them of the University’s zero-tolerance policy and acquainting them with the mechanisms for reporting.The University Counselling Centre, Medical Centre and Division of Students’ Affairs amongst other organs have been well positioned to address complaints by students. These organs have cut off the bureaucracy limiting the effectiveness of the Policy, by the direct reporting system of these Centres to the Vice-Chancellor. The University encourages students who have evidence to come forward. They are assured of their anonymity and safety.As a reputable Institution and one of the foremost Universities in Nigeria and sub-Sahara Africa, we are highly embarrassed by these allegations and we will do all that is necessary to ensure that this menace is checked in our institution.The University of Lagos is committed to providing conducive and safe learning environment where future leaders are trained to take responsibilities for their action.Mrs. Taiwo OloyedePrincipal Assistant Registrar (Communication Unit)     Unions Give Kaduna Government 21 Days Ultimatum Over Outstanding Salaries     The unions said having waited patiently for government to respond on the lingering issues, which started since 2014, the unions had no other alternative than to resort to the last option of industrial action.     A joint union of tertiary institutions in Kaduna State have asked the government to settle their outstanding demands lingering for 10 years in 21 days or face the consequences.The resolve of the union was contained in a statement signed by the joint chairman of the unions, Noah Dallami, on Sunday, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. The unions included academic, non-academic as well as Senior Staff Associations in the state owned tertiary institutions of Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria and College of Education, Gidan waya, Kafanchan.The unions said having waited patiently for government to respond on the lingering issues, which started since 2014, the unions had no other alternative than to resort to the last option of industrial action.“Having waited patiently on government for such a long time to resolve these lingering issues, our unions would be compelled to resume its 2014 suspended industrial action, only as a last resort, within 21 days of this notice.“Part of the demands is the implementation of the 10-year-old current salary structure payable to polytechnics and colleges of education known CONPCASS and CONTEDISS for academic and non-academic staff respectively,” he said.Other demands are the 65 years retirement age for staff of tertiary institutions.He said the unions had engaged successive governments in the state on the same issue including the current administration.“In view of these reasons, our unions once again wish to appeal to the governor of Kaduna State to use his good office to prevail on the state executive council to domesticate the retirement age law.“It should also implement the current salary structure of tertiary institutions in the state that is already 10 years old,” it noted.The unions also called on the governor to address critical infrastructural problems bedeviling the institutions in the state.     Mr Dallami pointed out that the institutions operate based on the provisions of the respective enabling laws establishing them, that are distinct from those of the mainstream civil service and other public service institutions.     United States Partners Tony Elumelu Foundation On Entrepreneurship     She said, “Under this partnership, we selected 20 U.S. Consulate/TEF Fellows to receive additional entrepreneurship training through a day-long program at the U.S. Consulate General that utilise some of the resources of the Young African Leaders Initiative including alumni of the Mandela Washington Fellowship.
The United States Government has announced a partnership with the Tony Elumelu Foundation to promote entrepreneurship initiatives in Nigeria as a way to create job growth, economic prosperity and political stability in the country.
Making the announcement in Lagos on Thursday, U.S Consul General, Claire Pierangelo, said that through a public diplomacy grant of $105, 000, the U.S. Consulate was supporting the training of a cohort of entrepreneurs from Southern Nigeria under the 2019 Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program.

“The 20 Fellows were selected from the Consular District with a priority being placed on five key sectors: energy, technology, transportation, agriculture, and health.
“This program is intended to give these Fellows insight to innovative U.S business models that will help them manage their businesses, market their products or services, seek capital, and develop partnerships.
“One of U.S Mission’s primary goals is to support Nigeria’s economic development, and entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth and success.
“That is why the U.S Department of State supports entrepreneurs all over the world by working with host nation governments and non-government organisations such as the Tony Elumelu Foundation.
“Our partnership with the Tony Elumelu Foundation promotes our ongoing efforts to advance entrepreneurship in Nigeria and is yet another example of our long-standing commitment to supporting Nigeria as it strives to diversify its economy.
“I applaud the leadership of the Tony Elumelu Foundation for their dedication to empowering budding African entrepreneurs as catalyst for the social and economic development of the continent.”
University Student Killed By Hoodlums In Kogi

Victor Uwaifo: Why I Sued Simi For N50 Million Damages
Uwaifo accused the songstress of "stealing" his intellectual property, 'Joromi'.
Victor Uwaifo and Simi
Legendary Nigerian singer and guitarist, Sir Victor Uwaifo, has revealed why he sued Nigerian singer, Simisola Bolatito Ogunleye, aka Simi, for N50 million.
Uwaifo accused the songstress of "stealing" his intellectual property, 'Joromi'.
In an exclusive interview with SaharaReporters shortly after his performance at the just concluded National Festival of Arts and Culture in Edo State, he said: “We’re in court already I sued her at the federal high court for N50 million. They will be coming to court.”
When Sahara Reporters asked if Simi had reached out to him privately, he answered: “No, only through her lawyers. We will meet in court.”
Over a year ago, Uwaifo had told SaharaReporters that Simi was in trouble for failing credit for the song, Joromi, which she remixed.
He had said, when asked if he was going to take any legal action against Simi, “One after the other. I cannot just take everybody to court at the same time. I don’t know whether he or she; I know she is but I know somebody is behind it.
An LP was sent as a compliment; I'm still looking at it but they were planning to come to Benin to see me. Up till now, they haven't come. So I'm just putting that one on hold. 'Joromi' is a franchise. The name never existed before. Benin don’t have 'J' in their language. If any started with 'J' in Benin then it is fake. All consonant words start with vowel sounds. For example, if I use the trademark of one of these soft drinks, it is wrong. So Simi is in trouble.”     Walter’s Wake-keep By Rudolf Ogoo Okonkwo     Wakes of Nigerian-Americans who died in America is a different ball game. Some consider that the more legitimate kind of wake. Friends and associates sympathize more and understand the need to raise money to support the family and in some cases, to transport the body back to Nigeria.     In the Boston metropolitan area is a Liberian who loved to attend Nigerian parties. (Let us call him Walter, because we have no permission to use his real name.) He loved Nigerian music, jollof rice, pepper soup, Shoki dance and watching Nigerians spray dollar bills like snow flakes at these parties. Trust Nigerians in America, they come up with every reason to throw a party - child dedication, wedding anniversary, birthday, graduation, send-off, wake-keep, etc.     Every party is special but none is as special as a wake-keep. If you rent a hall to celebrate your 50th birthday or 25th wedding anniversary, or even your child's 5th birthday, or your child’s dedication in church, the general feeling is that you have the money to spare. People will still come, enjoy, and may even give you gifts, but it is mostly not seen as obligatory. But when it is a wake-keep, the party from conception to execution is aimed at raising money to assist the bereaved to go home and attend the funeral of the dead. The MC makes that clear every ten minutes of the event. And since people are expected to drop something," organizers make sure that there are a lot of food and drinks to justify the things people will "drop".
Another feature of these wake-keep, other than the fact that most of those for whom the events are held had never been to America, is that there is an unwritten understanding between the organizers and the attendees that whatever the attendee gives is documented, noted and permanently preserved for the time when it would be necessary to return the favor. In Igbo community, they even have a proverb that backs it up. It says: whatever a man gives to another man is a loan waiting to be repaid.
This last part accounts for the proliferation of wake-keep. It is like a form of isusu. You wait for your turn to collect return on your investments. Those who had lost their parents before coming to America waste no time in holding wakes for their uncles and aunts, not minding whether they were close or not. Some will roll out the wake-keep red carpet for their step-mothers and step-fathers, even if they never saw eye-to-eye in life. All that they needed to say was that their parents died when they were young and it was this uncle, this aunt, this step-father, this step-mother, even step-sister and step-brother that stepped in and raised them.
Who are you to argue with a grieving fellow? After all, the ever-increasing cost of burial at home means that no matter who dies, once the 3 am call comes, the demand for money follows. And having someone abroad means pressure to go for “a befitting” oversea-higher-standard burial.
Wake-keep is so ubiquitous that people now simplify it by saying Peter's wake or Angela's wake, instead of properly labeling it as the wake of Peter's father or Angela's mother. It saves everyone the headache of figuring out the real relationship.
Once you are part of the wake-keep-going circus, it is expected that, sooner or later, you will get your own wake. One guy having difficulty completing his house in the village manufactured his own wake out of the death of his maternal grandmother.
Recently, the expectation of going home for the funeral has been waived. It is now acceptable that the person who collected all those money at the wake did not even go home for the funeral. That he or she presumably sent the money home is satisfactory.
Wakes of Nigerian-Americans who died in America is a different ball game. Some consider that the more legitimate kind of wake. Friends and associates sympathize more and understand the need to raise money to support the family and in some cases, to transport the body back to Nigeria. Though recently there has been the increasing grumble for Nigerian-Americans to obtain life insurance to cover transportation of their body home, if they so wish, and still leave something for those they left behind.
Walter is a permanent fixture at these wakes. He drinks to his heart’s desire, dances until his waist aches. He once inquired about joining People's Club after he watched the display of the club members at some of these wakes, but he pulled back when told how much it costs to join the club.
Then, one day, Walter's mother died. And Walter had his wake.
He contacted his Nigerian friends who told him how to plan a wake. He did not have close friends to constitute his Committee of Friends so he became his own one-man Committee of Friends. He did all the running-around and spent all the money needed for drinks, hall, DJ, photographer and food. On the day of the wake, Nigerians came in large numbers. They ate, drank, danced, and, went home.
The morning after Walter's wake, he went to the office of a friend of mine who had given him $50. The average money given at these wakes is $100. Walter thanked my friend so profusely that my friend found it odd. Something a phone call would have taken care of, Walter came in person.
When Walter left, my friend called around to find out why Walter was super appreciative. Could it be because someone who didn’t know him very well gave him $50?
What my friend found out was that all those Nigerians who came, ate, drank, danced, and then went home, none gave Walter any money because he never gave any money at all those wakes he had attended over the years.

The officer urged farmers to work closely with Agric Ministry to benefit from governor''s incentive packages aimed at boosting animal production.'
Mr Okeke gave tips on how pig farm could be constructed as well as promised to produce manuals for achieving odourless pig farming.
He enjoined pig farmers to go to the grassroots to convince other farmers to join them to access government facilities in order to develop their farms.

Experts want critical thinkers to lead, transform Nigeria.
Stakeholders who converged on the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (NAU) Awka, Anambra State have canvassed the emergence of critical thinkers in leadership positions with a view to transforming Nigeria.
They stated this during the Ninth World Philosophy Day of the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) at the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Arts, with the theme, “Critical Thinking, Leadership and Social Transformation.
”.
A former Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Rev.
Fr.
Professor Obi Oguejiofor noted that leaders are drawn to the led if they possess critical thinking, analytical, communicative, creative, open-minded and problem solving to lead and transform organisations or institutions socially and economically.
He lamented that the problems dogging Nigeria and Africa’s developmental path stem from absence of leaders who could think critically from time to time, likening the failure of Nigerians to think critically in the clamour for power shift, which he said, does not produce the best leader who could give justice.
Also, former Chair, Department of English and Speech, A & T State University, North Carolina, United States of America, Professor Chimalu Nwankwo lamented that Africans do not think critically hence their inability to think on their own, but rely on dictates of foreigners.
Another stakeholder, Professor A.
U.
Igwe wondered if Nigerians apply critical thinking in whatever they do just as he condemned leaders who choose to become egocentric rather than critical thinkers when occupy leadership positions,.
Igwe, who is a Professor of History, at NAU, said there were few African leaders who were guided by critical thinking, particularly the former President of Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara who he described as an ideal leader who employed critical thinking and rational application of force during his regime.
He observed that the UNESCO knows the important role philosophy plays in leadership; hence the declaration of November 21 every year as World Philosophy Day, stressing that critical thinking propels leaders to better the lot of their people.
On his part, Dr.
Emmanuel Umezinwa of the Department of Music and the first Master Degree Graduate of Philosophy Department, said western system of thinking has inadvertently made Africans to sharpen their intellect and give too much thought to thinking, adding that there is an “overblown idea of thought.

Govt.
should enforce ban on religious activities in stadia ― Rojenny Proprietor.
Rommy Ezeonwuka, Proprietor of Rojenny Stadium and Tourists Village, has called on government at all levels to ban religious and other non-sporting activities in all spots sports stadia in the country.
Ezeonwuka made the call when he received members of Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Anambra chapter, who were on tour of sports facilities in the state.
The tour of sports was part of the three day SWAN Week activities in the state.
The facility investor blamed the collapse of most Nigerian stadia on their use for non-sporting activities like religious crusades and political rallies.
He berated successive sports administrators in the country for misuse of the multi-billion Naira facilities for momentary gain.
READ ALSO: Women groups want FG to declare state-of-emergency on GBV.
Ezeonwuka said Rojenny was still relevant more than three decades because he refused to allow such distractions in his facility.
“One major factor that is killing our sports facility is the permission to use them for activities that are not sports related, it is sad that government allows crusade, political rallies, burials in our stadia.
“Look at the National Stadium in Surulere, National Stadium Abuja and other facilities that should be used for training our youths for world championships collapsing because our administrators rent them out for money.
“Even here in Anambra, Achebe Stadium, Fegge and Ikpeazu Stadium have collapsed because of these things, it should be stopped and government should outlaw it.
“Sports has a spirit and you must respect the spirit of sports, that is why I have refused to allow anybody to use here for any other thing other than sports, that is the secret of Rojenny survival after 35 years.
“This is the only individually-owned Olympic size Stadium where you can hold most major games without leaving the stadium complex,” he said.
Ezeonwuka said Nigeria had all it takes to dominate sports at the world stage but regretted that administrators have reduced the country to mere training ground where other countries come to adopt talented athletes.
He said Nigeria must try to retain their best so that the country could enjoy the benefits of sporting economy like Europe, America and now, Asia.
On the coming Nigeria Police Games scheduled to hold at Rojenny next year, Ezeonwuka described Rojenny as the proverbial parish waiting for the priest to come and conduct the Holy Mass.
“Bahrain adopted about 10 Nigerians athletes, the young girls that recently won the world championship for them trained here, we must stop the West from poaching on us by placing value on what we have.
“Rojenny is like a parish waiting for the priest, the priest is the government who is supposed to create programmes so that athletes can make use of what we have here.
“It is not easy to run a stadium, even the government is finding it difficult, so those of us in the private sector need encouragement.
“I want to thank the Nigerian Police for finding here worthy and we promise that the 2020 Games will be the best for them,” he said.
In his remark, Philip Balepo, a veteran journalist, said Rojenny deserved a golden place in the history of Nigerian sports because of what he had done for the Nigerian youth.
Balepo, who expressed satisfaction with the ambience of Rojenny environment, called on Nigerian sports administrators to visit the place and see how best it could be optimised for sports growth.
The SWAN team was led by its chairman Anthony Oji.

Nigeria may miss SDG on healthcare, says Soludo.
Former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof.
Chukwuma Soludo, has said that if the Federal Government does not initiate good reforms, the country may miss out on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on healthcare.
Soludo spoke at the 26th Annual Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) Development Forum themed ‘The Nigerian Healthcare Situation: The Way Forward’ in Abuja.
According to him, tackling healthcare challenges in the country requires decisive and comprehensive war on poverty, inequality, illiteracy or poor public health education, nutrition, water and sanitation, as well as provision of adequate and accessible public health facilities and insurance schemes.
“The United Nations SDG 3 envisions that by 2030 all countries should ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.
“There are about 13 specific targets to meet.
From all indications, Nigeria is set to miss the targets and the SDG on health except some dramatic and systematic reforms are initiated and sustained from now until 2030,” he said.
Government’s expenditure on health (like other sectors) needs to be ratcheted up and its facilitation and regulatory functions strengthened, he said, adding that serious attention at fora like that, should also focus on maximising the latent potential of the ‘other hand’ (individuals and non-state actors) in reversing what LAPO identifies as the ‘progressive decline’ of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.
He noted that the country’s healthcare statistics was as scary as its poverty and unemployment statistics, using the average life expectancy as summary indicator.
The former governorship aspirant in Anambra State identified a strong correlation between poverty/inequality and health.
He explained that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provided for free and compulsory primary education, as well as free secondary education.
In his opening remarks, chairman, LAPO Board of Directors, Dr.
Osarenren Emokpae, called on the federal and state governments to increase budgetary allocation for the health sector.
He said the increment would help reduce medical tourism, as some of the elite would begin to patronise local health facilities rather than go abroad.
In 2018, Nigeria was ranked 187 out of 191 countries in the world that are not complying with the Universal Health Coverage (UCH), he noted, adding that LAPO, in its inclusive services to its clients and the general public, made healthcare a very important component of its services.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LAPO, Godwin Ehigiamusoe, said the country’s health sector required urgent and collective attention and action, adding that the healthcare statistics in some cases were very depressing.

Residents flee town of Kanu’s lawyer after policemen’s death.
A siege allegedly laid to Oraifite in Ekwusigo Local Government of Anambra State by a combined team of soldiers and policemen forced residents to flee the community yesterday.
The desertion of the community came on the heels of declaration of Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lawyer to the Supreme Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, wanted by the state police command over an alleged killing of Oliver Innoma Abbey, the Oraifite Area Commander and the SARS Commander, Ichi Sector, Patrick Agbazue.

Admiral Allison MaduekeNo doubt, the story of the 30-month Nigerian Civil War of 1967 would remain a critical point for discussion anytime Nigeria is being examined in history to project for a better future.
So also the agitation for restructuring and June 12, 1993, presidential election, acclaimed to have been won by the late business mogul, Chief M.
K.
O Abiola but annulled by the then military Head of State, Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida.
These issues seem recurring and cannot be overlooked as they impact on national discourse.
Twenty-one years since Nigeria returned to civil rule, those factors that led to the civil war, the unending agitations for restructuring and the perceived domination of governance system by a particular section of the country are still visible markers that still haunt the country and continue to stifle its development.
As a matter of fact, most of the issues have not been adequately tackled many leas put in proper perspectives in a manner that could have helped in reshaping the nation’s growth and development.
These factors were part of issues that were publicly deliberated upon, when former Chief of Naval Staff and one-time Military Administrator of Anambra and the Imo State, Admiral Allison Madueke (rtd), launched his autobiography last week.
It is entitled Riding the Storms, with God in My Sails at MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos.
Seeking inclusiveness through regional development commissions.
Oduah.
The quest for the establishment of development commissions for the remaining geo-political zones in the country apart from the South-south and Northeast gained momentum recently with the introduction of three bills to that effect in the Senate.
ONYEDIKA AGBEDO looks at the genesis of the move, the gimmicks around it and its likely outcome in this report.
There is a cool ‘war’ in the Senate among the geo-political zones in the country following penultimate Wednesday’s reintroduction of a bill seeking to establish the South East Development Commission.
The 8th Senate had passed the bill, sponsored by Senator Stella Oduah (PDP, Anambra North) on December 12, 2018, but it did not get President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent.
Should the bill secure the nod of the lawmakers again and possibly receive presidential assent this time around, it would give birth to a commission charged with the responsibility of receiving and managing funds specially allocated by the Federal Government for the rehabilitation, reconstruction and reparation for lost houses and businesses of victims of the Nigerian civil war.
The commission would also address any other environmental or developmental challenges confronting the zone.
Clause 15 (2a) of the bill, which identifies source of funding for the commission, stipulates that the equivalent of 10 per cent of the total monthly statutory allocation due to the member states of the commission shall be from the Federation Account.
