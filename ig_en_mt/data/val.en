We are confusing regulation with policy.
There was a determination on this USSD, even before the appointment of the Minister, he stated.
It is not about the good boy, but this is commercial and the normal things have been done.
Operators did not come up overnight to charge N4.
It was robustly deliberated upon and a decision jointly taken before the legal instrument was published for implementation by all parties involved,” he explained further.
Similarly, the President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Olusola Teniola, vehemently queried where the autonomy of the NCC lies if the ministry continues to interfere.
Teniola stated that the Federal Government needed to allow the NCC’s independence to enforce decisions made, especially as it bothers on the development of the telecommunications industry.
Indeed, The Guardian checks showed that there is a legal basis for the NCC’s intervention to protect telecoms service consumers (i.e.bank customers who use USSD for financial transactions).
Earlier in his keynote address on ``Reforming the Maritime Sector in Onitsha; Priority Areas, Potential Projects and the Way Forward,’’ Mr Moghalu noted that transportation was indispensable in the World today.
The event was held at All Saints Cathedral, Onitsha.
According to him, ongoing concessionary processes to address certain issues resolved that they will continue working to complete the port project.
Mr Moghalu said this while exchanging views with newsmen after a sensitisation seminar of South East zone stakeholders by NIWA.
NCC is also saddled with the responsibility of promoting fair competition in the communications industry and protection of services and facilities providers from misuse of market power or anti-competitive and unfair practices by other service or facilities providers or equipment suppliers; and the responsibility to general responsibility of the Commission for economic and technical regulation of the communications industry.
To many Nigerians, the use of USSD sounded new, but checks by The Guardian showed that the initiative has been in effect since 2014.
This initiative, however, got a boost this year, when the NCC did a determination report on it.
The report obtained from NCC’s website termed ‘Determination of USSD Pricing,’ dated July 23, 2019, and signed by the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof.
Umar Danbatta, revealed, among other things, that a USSD session is 20 seconds; the cost of a USSD session is N1.
63K the price floor for a 20 seconds USSD service is N1.
63k while price cap for a 20 Seconds USSD Session is N4.
The Determination document envisaged the implementation of the USSD charges by the mobile network operators (MNOs) to take effect from September 1, 2019, and remains valid and binding on licensees.
However, Whether the MTN took official permission before its announcement to its customers remains unclear, as telecoms licensees are obligated to always get official approval/permission of the regulator before going to market to introduce any new tariff or pricing regime to their subscribers.
The legal document also notes that “the Commission reserves the right to amend and review this Determination at any time, as well as to consider other options to incentivise the communications industry,” and not the ministry.
It further states that such a review may be necessitated by major change in the market conditions and/or the underlining principles of this Determination.
In the formulation of this Determination, it was gathered that the banks had applied to the NCC for USSD codes for their mobile transactions, where they were now directed to the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) independently.
Meanwhile, ALTON’s accounts of how the USSD usage by the banks began and the support of the Commission in allowing the banks to use the USSD platform to facilitate digital financial inclusion is also revealing in the document obtained by The Guardian.
According to ALTON, while telecommunication services and infrastructure became more accessible in the country, the banks identified the USSD channel as a cost-efficient way of delivering financial services to their customers.
“The banks subsequently applied for and were granted USSD shortcodes to deliver financial services to bank customers by the Nigerian Communications Commission (“the Commission”).
‘‘At the nascent stage of USSD development for the financial services sector, the billing mode adopted by our members was to charge the telecommunications service consumer directly, which is referred to as end-user billing.
Green House won the track events while White House won in football match.
The body also said the banks also used this channel to grow significant revenues running into billions of Naira in view of the large disparity between the cost charged by its members and the charge imposed by the banks on their customers.
For instance, data from the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) showed that between January and March 2019, USSD-based transactions conducted through mobile money by some 2.3 million customers averaged 41.1 million valued at N810 billion worth of transactions.
Onitsha, Feb. 25, 2020 (MOI) Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer  (CEO), National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Mr George Moghalu, says he will strive to make the Onitsha River Port functional during his tenure.
This, alone, according to industry watchers, indicates the high volume of USSD-based transactions that are enabled monthly by the MNOs’ infrastructure.
ALTON noted that these new services continued to place a strain on its members’ network resources, which resulted in their continued and further investments to ensure that the SDCCH channel was dimensioned to handle the increased traffic as a result of the new banking services being deployed on it.
The telecoms body pointed out that services provided by the banks constitute a minimum of 90 per cent of the total traffic on the USSD channels of its members.
However, since the suspension of the USSD charges by the Ministers, no authority has stopped the banks from charging customers an amount ranging from N10- N50, according to ALTON and confirmation by sources within the banking industry.
New images have surfaced of what really happened during the September pressure testing of Boeing’s new 777X aircraft.
September’s pressure test was widely reported to have failed, with a cargo door being blamed for the issue.
Now, it seems that the situation was a lot more serious than that.
According to reports, it wasn’t just the door that ruptured, but the entire fuselage!.
Earlier reports that a cargo door blew out are not entirely unfounded.
Apparently the fuselage skin ripped open just behind the wing, and as such a passenger door was dislodged and fell to the factory floor.
The damage is clearly far worse than originally revealed; the test aircraft is a complete write-off.
Of the incident, Boeing spokesperson, Paul Bergmanm, explained that in the final load testing of the 777X static test airplane, the team conducted a test that involves bending the wings of the airplane up to a level far beyond anything expected in commercial service.
“A testing issue occurred during the final minutes of the test, at approximately 99 per cent of the final test loads, and involved a depressurisation of the aft fuselage.
The test team followed all safety protocols.
“As we shared on our October 23 earnings call, our root cause assessment continues, and we are pleased with the progress we are making as we complete our detailed analysis.
What we’ve seen to date reinforces our prior assessment that this will not have a significant impact on the design or our preparations for first flight.
We do not see any impact from the test on the overall program schedule.
“On the call, we did update our target for first delivery from late 2020 to early 2021.
As we’d said for some time, there had been significant risk to the late 2020 timeline.
What changed is that we now have a clearer understanding of how the GE9X engine issue has impacted the details of our flight test program.
For example, the timing of engines for the remaining flight test airplanes will affect when they begin flying, which in turn affects our detailed test schedules.
When we account for all these factors, we expect to fly in early 2020 deliver in 2021.
Saturday 21st of May 2016, The Great Hall, Kensington, London, hosted Africa’s largest awards ceremony for Women in Europe and the Commonwealth.
In its fifth year Women4Africa is steadily growing its vision of elevating the ordinary African woman doing extraordinary things.
The Special guest of honour and Special Woman award recipient was Mrs Aisha Buhari.
She was ably represented by an official delegation of three governors’ wives led by Mrs Florence Ajimobi wife of the Oyo state governor, accompanied by the Wife of the governor of Ebonyi State Mrs Umahi and Zamfara state Mrs Yari.
Also in attendance was The Senior Special Advisor to the President on foreign and diaspora affairs.
Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa.
Founders of Women4Africa Sam and Tola Onigbanjo were delighted at the kind gesture of Mrs Buhari and in response to her official statement read vowed to keep on elevating “The continent of Africa and its amazing Women”.
While speaking about homeland security, George “Gaffe” Bush once said, “I just want you to know that, when we talk about war, we’re really talking about peace.
``Sports and culture elongates life; nurture health and one can earn a living from it too.’’
Well, in contrast, I just want you to know that when we talk about gender, we’re really talking about gender.
Which is to say, we are not just talking about women.
Most people wrongly associate gender issues with women’s issues.
I recall doing a degree in Gender Studies and when people asked what I was studying and I replied gender, they would nevertheless proceed to ask, “So, what is women’s studies about?”.
It was baffling.
In actual fact I was not interested in women’s studies alone or I would have chosen that course.
Instead, I chose to study gender because I am interested in masculinity and femininity, in gender norms attributed to the male and female sexes, in the interaction – the never-ending conflicts and also the opportunities to live together harmoniously – caused by gender roles.
What are those roles? The answer depends on many things, including the particular environment that you find yourself in.
In a country like Nigeria, gender roles not only vary from region to region but they’re also shaped by our tetchy colonial past, and the education and religion that came with that predicament.
Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world where, for example, women have reigned not only as queens but as kings.
In fact, female kings such as Ahebi Ugbabe who ruled Igala in Igboland in the twentieth century are arguably a precursor to transgender (people who express their gender outside of the norm) discussions today.
However, Nigeria is also a country where, to give another example, if you are male you can pass your nationality to a non-Nigerian female through marriage.
If on the other hand you are a Nigerian female, by all means set your eyes on a non-Nigerian husband, but our legislation will always consider your marriage as one to a foreigner.
If you are female, gender roles such as housewife, the weaker sex, the shrinking violet, the bimbo etc.
may be used to describe you.
If you are male, the roles of provider, macho man, gentleman or rational thinker may be attributed to you.
Furthermore, although gender norms are limiting for both sexes (e.
g.
men should never be vulnerable and women should never be bossy yada yada yada) since most powerful traits are seen to be masculine, if you are a woman there is perhaps even more of an incentive to define womanhood for yourself.
So why is all of this political? After all the column is “Gender Politics”.
Well, for three primary reasons.
Firstly, precisely because gender and power are closely linked.
Secondly, because maleness and power are also closely linked.
And thirdly, because the first two points cause problems.
You may like to read the column regularly.
Not because the author is claiming, like any good salesperson, that it will gain you great relationships, a happy life, prosperity and mind-blowing sex.
In all honesty, I doubt reading this column will bring you any closer to that.
(And if against the odds it does, please at least buy me dinner.
Chairman of the Occasion, Dr Stanislaus Igbokwe said that without sports and culture, a nation was not complete.
But my column may give you a greater understanding of how gender norms shape our realities.
It may cause you to marvel, as I do, at the social, sexual and cultural roles between genders and how those relate to our inner sense of power as well as to political structures.
And that in return may have a positive effect.
At the very least, we can quarrel about all things gender-related and that’s always a blast (or not).
One more thing for now.
If you thought that there are only two genders you are mistaken.
There are numerous, seventy-one (at least) according to the pre-populated list that Facebook users can choose from when choosing a gender identity.
That said, the main focus in my column is gender politics as it relates to women and men.
ANAMBRA GOVERNMENT, I HAIL YOU ON SECURITY By Regina Igwebuike
``Sports and culture elongates life; nurture health and one can earn a living from it too.’’
Chairman of the Occasion, Dr Stanislaus Igbokwe said that without sports and culture, a nation was not complete.
Patron of Green House, which took overall 1st position in the field/track events, Mr Paul Okpala Akuluono pleaded with state government to harness sports talents from school children.
Another House patron, Prince Augustine Udoh said that work and play make for balanced growth of a child, stressing that parents should not relinquish children’s training to teachers. You should start fighting vices from home.
``We solicit for sponsors’ support in facilitating acquisition of sporting playgrounds. Also, the nature of our terrain has led us to pave the school compound with inter-locking stones,’’ Adawai said.
Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor, Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese has praises Anambra State Government for using its security apparatus to track two Awka Diocesan priests kidnapped last year in Ondo State.
The prelate noted that Gov. Obiano used the state’s security apparatus to track down, the kidnapped priests.
``Children are our future. Anambra State should invest in school sports. I appeal to government to construct Attah road, linking Nkpor-Umuoji road across St. Edmund to Nkpor Old road,’’ Akuluono said.
The bishop decried incessant and barbaric killings of innocent Nigerian’s especially Christians.
Ezeokafor made the commendation at Ukpo, Dunukofia Local Government Area on Feb. 6, during burial of mother of Bishop of Mrs Rebecca Amatu.
``Academic excellence, moral probity and physical fitness are our watchwords. Here, we preach against cultism and our security men are always on alert. Anyone caught over cultism will face the law.
He thanked Gov. Willie Obiano for his giant strides in the area of security, urging him to sustain the tempo.
In a welcome address, School Manager, Rev. Fr. Michael Adawai said they applied holistic approach to children’s educational development, noting that they had zero tolerance for cultism.
Ezeokafor, however, also expressed shock at gruesome murder of Lawan Andimi, Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, Michika LGA Adamawa State by terrorists.
He said any government that did not value the sacredness of life was a failure.
He stressed that government at the centre should provide the enabling environment for security of life and property.
According to him, Government at the centre must encourage local policing to secure lives of the people, who elected them into office.
``Any government that cannot do the needful to secure life and property of its citizens should surrender; use whatever God endowed you with to work toward eternal life.
``Academic excellence, moral probity and physical fitness are our watchwords. Here, we preach against cultism and our security men are always on alert. Anyone caught over cultism will face the law.
BISHOP AMATU BURIES 96-YEAR-OLD MUM By Regina Igwebuike : https://www.
In a welcome address, School Manager, Rev. Fr. Michael Adawai said they applied holistic approach to children’s educational development, noting that they had zero tolerance for cultism.
She thanked management of St. Edmund Group of schools for going extra the mile to borrow St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, Nkpor sporting ground to accommodate all sporting events.
Lady Lizzy Ewuzie, Area Education Officer (AEO), Idemili North represented the commissioner at the event.
According to the commissioner said sports help in mental, physical and psychological development of learners, stressing that properly engaging youths in sports will make them lose interest in social vices.
7, 2020 (MOI) Catholic Bishop of Okigwe Diocese, Imo State, Most Rev. Solomon Amatu accompanied by family and friends, bid farewell to his late mother, Mrs Rebecca Mgboye Amatu aged 96.
Prof. Omenugha made the call during Inter-house sports competition organised by St. Edmund Group of Schools, Nkpor.
The deceased was born on Feb. 14, 1923 into family of late Pa/Mrs Anakonwa of Oranto Village, married to late Pius Amatu of Obinagu Akpu Village, both in Ukpo.
SCHOOLS URGED TO PROMOTE SPORTS, CURB CULTISM AS ST EDMUND SCHOOLS NKPOR HOLD INTER-HOUSE SPORTS
Speaking while concelebrating the burial Mass at St. Simon Catholic Church, Ukpo, Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor, Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese said that burying the dead was one of the ``corporal works of mercy’’.
Nkpor (Idemili North LGA), Feb. 25, 2020 (MOI) Anambra State Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof. Kate Omenugha has urged private and public schools to promote sports as panacea against cultism and other vices among youths.
Mr Emmanuel Nwafor, member representing Orumba South Constituency suggested proper checking of the seals of the consultants in other to ascertain their level of authenticity because fake seals abound.
Ezeokafor added that the deceased lived her life in the hope of resurrection, which was a fulfillment of what we believe in as Christians.
He emphasised that death was an answered prayer as one transcended from temporal life to eternity to live at peace with God.
The prelate noted that Mrs Amatu was energetic, beautiful as well as a good singer with a golden voice.
``She was a notable lead singer in all ceremonies and activities in her town and beyond, which merited her name `Onu Ogene’.
He explains: ``life is a gift from God, which must be respected’’, urging those who fail to take care of their parents at old age to retrace their steps so as to reap God’s promise of long life’’.
One of the deceased sons, Most Rev.
Solomon Amatu said that his mother was non believer and became a Christian convert in 1962 to Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) as a result of miraculous healing of her husband when he was down, bedridden after attending a crusade.
Bishop Amatu noted that she was an ardent and devout member of CAC until 2003, when she became a Catholic faith after his Episcopal Ordination.
According to him, she embraced the conversion and convincingly remained ardent and devoted to it until her last breath, praying God for a repose of her soul.
Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, who attended the event, commiserated with Amatu family, praying God to grant them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
Gov.
Obiano thanked those, who came to pray for the deceased’s soul, especially those who came from far places, praying God to grant them journey mercies.
He noted that the state was enjoying security to the glory of God.
Delivering a tribute at the grave side, Dr Solomon Anigbankpu, on behalf of the deceased’s grand/great grandchildren said that grandma knew precisely what good education could do to anyone, who persisted to the end.
``She believes that it is better to develop common sense first before western education to avoid behaving and acting like a child.
``She lived a life of prayer, selfless service, high sense of responsibility and charity, humility, hard work, tenacity and doggedness.
``Her prayer life is infectious and you can never stay with her without being infected,’’ he emphasised.
Dignitaries at the ceremony include Archbishop Valerian Okeke of Onitsha Archdiocese, Owerri Provincial Bishops, a former Governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi.
A former INEC Chairman, Prof.
Maurice Iwu, Anambra Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Ndidi Mezue, Traditional Rulers and people from all walks of life attended too.

Okwuosa explained that most buildings within the old Awka were built several years ago, hence the disorderly nature of most villages.
6, 2020 (MOI) Anambra State Government has donated a parcel of land on which a permanent site on which the Federal Judiciary can build the Awka Division of Court of Appeal.
Gov. Willie Obiano announced this while receiving Judges and staff members of the judiciary, led by President of Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa at the Governor''s Lodge, Amawbia.'
``This will entail serious demolition.
Receiving the delegation, Gov. Obiano said his administration would always provide necessary facilities that would enhance prompt dispensation of justice.
``Compensation will be paid by the state government in order to get Awka to become a standard city.
The governor said that arrangements had been finalised for procurement of stenograph for judges to facilitate justice delivery.
He announced that it would made available to 25 courts in the first batch.
In addition to procurement of stenograph, Gov. Obiano said that his administration would train, retrain judges and other judicial staff to enable them to get acquainted with modern system of justice delivery.
``However, this will not hinder the demolition of any building that poses threat to the community.’’
``My administration has been taking care of Judges.
Their welfare is my utmost concern.
I cleared the accumulated debt owed judges by previous administrations.
``Indeed it is a milestone achievement for my administration under the leadership of Court of Appeal President, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa.
I sincerely appreciate your support,’’ Obiano said.
The governor stressed that his administration had maintained robust relationship among the three arms of government, promising to ensure no interference and adequate separation of duties.
President, Court of Appeal, Justice Bulkachuwa, said that process for the inaugurating of Court of appeal in the state started in 2018, when Gov.

He added that development control would entail site visits to ensure that work would be going on as approved.
``Consultants in the building industry are expected to append their seal in drawings in other to take liability for any default in the building.”
Okwuosa, then, explained that ACTDA would look at buildings and development control, adding that building control involves paper work where the developer is expected to bring survey plans, evidence of ownership and power of attorney.
6, 2020 (MOI) Anambra State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (ASPHCDA) in collaboration with partner agencies have announced 2020 first round of National Immunisation Plus Days (NIPDs) in the state.
Executive Secretary, ASPHCDA, Dr Chioma Ezenyimulu made the announcement during the State Social Mobilisation Committee (SSMC) meeting at ASPHCDA office complex, Awka.
She noted that the event which was always held between March and April in past years would now hold between Feb.

``The flag-off ceremony of NIPDs will be held jointly with that of Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Week (MNCHW) on Feb.
11, at Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC), Akpo, Aguata Local Government Area (LGA).
``Master plan supersedes structural plan because it later takes cognizance of structural, aesthetic and development aspects of any building with a view for future intent.
Dr Ezenyimulu said the 4-day programme would hold in all PHCs, designated General, Teaching, Mission and private hospitals and schools.
``Also house to house, that includes Churches, mosques, markets, village square, motor parks and wherever children are found.
``During this period children from zero to 59 months of age will be vaccinated with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), irrespective of previous immunisation status,‘’ she said.
State Health Educator, ASPHCDA, Mrs Uju Onwuegbuzina said that the SSMC was established to aid the resolution of issues that might arise in the course of the campaigns such as non compliance or rejections.

He said that plans were on ground to demarcate Anambra into three development zones while ACTDA would be in charge of Anambra Central to ensure rapid development in all the areas.
UNICEF Communication for Development (C4D) Consultant, Mr Felix Okocha commended members of SSMC for their efforts in communicating activities of the agency to ensure that Ndi Anambra would be healthy.
I praise you all for what you are doing so far and will appeal that you continue to provide this support so that the objectives of the agency will be achieved.
Managing Director, ACTDA, Ven. Amaechi Okwuosa said that the Authority, under the office of the governor was charged with the responsibility of preparing master plan of Awka, turning the capital into Dubai or Taiwan.
