Dr Okpala said that the disease symptoms include fever, headaches, sore throat, general body weakness, coughing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle and chest pains.
He explained that in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nostrils, mouths and other body openings were observed.
Commissioner said the time between the infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease ranges from 3 to 21 days.
He emphasised that early treatment and diagnosis increase the chances of survival.
Dr Okpala explained that people of all age groups, who come in contact with urine, faeces, saliva, and blood of rats, stand higher risk of contracting the disease.
People living in rat-infested environment also have increased chances of coming in contact with rats.
People who consume potentially contaminated food stuff especially those left open overnight or dried outside in the open.
People who handle or process rodents for consumption and those who do not perform hand hygiene when appropriate.
Relatives who care for sick persons with unexplained illnesses at home, doctors, nurses and other health workers providing direct patient care in the absence of standard precautions.
Hospital staff that clean, disinfect contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies without adequate protective gear.
He adds: Laboratory staff who handle blood samples of suspected Lassa fever patients, without appropriate precautions, medical or support staff that prepare or handle dead bodies without appropriate precautions can contract the disease’’.
To reduce the risk of Lassa fever, he gave the following advice:.
Ensure proper environmental sanitation, i.e.
The ministry is also working toward facilitating the Diaspora Estate and portal, where Ndi Anambra in The Diaspora can register online to ascertain their numeric strength.
keep your environment clean at all times, and block all holes in your houses to prevent rats from entering.
Cover your dustbins and dispose refuse properly.
Communities should set up dump sites very far from their homes to reduce the chances of having rodents within homes.
Store food stuff like rice, garri, beans, corn/maize and the likes in air tight containers.
Avoid drying food stuff outside on the floor and on roadside where it will be exposed to contamination.
Youths of Anambra will undergo training on Project Smart Job’’ that will make booking of hotel, transportation and other online services, easy and accessible.
He advised Ndi Anambra to avoid bush fires which could lead to displacement of rats from bushes to human dwellings and eliminate rats in homes and communities by setting rat traps.
He enjoined healthcare workers to practice standard precautions at all times, that is, wearing gloves when handling patients or providing care to an ill patient/relative.
Healthcare workers should maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever, be vigilant and look out for symptoms of Lassa fever.
Dr Okpala advised that any febrile illness that has not responded to 48 hours use of anti-malaria or antibiotics should raise an index of suspicion for Lassa fever.
He also called on the healthcare workers to report any suspected case of Lassa fever to their local government disease surveillance and notification officer to access care.
The commissioner said that Anambra State Ministry of Health was on the alert and fully prepared to respond to any outbreak of Lassa fever in the state.
GOVERNMENT ASSURES OF READINESS TO COMPLETE OKPUNOEZE /UMEOJILIGWE NNEWI ROADS By Mercy Akaolisa/Theresa Muowe :
Anambra State Government has assured the leadership of Uruagu Nnewi Community of its readiness to complete Okpunoeze/Umeojiligwe Uruagu Nnewi roads.
Special Adviser (SA) to the Governor on Budget Monitoring and Efficiency, Mr Melie Onyejepu said this while addressing the group after an inspection tour on ongoing reconstruction of drainage channel of the roads.
Mr Onyejepu expressed the determination of the Gov. Obiano-led administration to ensure that the roads were in good shape, noting that the contractor had since been mobilised back to the site.
The economy of Anambra State is doing well because Gov. Willie Obiano has invested a lot on security, education, good roads, and in other vital areas.
According to him, the roads were delayed because of the prolonged rains, the redesigning of the drainage channel as well as increase in the bearing strength on the pavement.
The SA re-assured them that Government was committed to completing the roads before the next raining season.
The President General, Uruagu Community, Mr Charles Nwoye praised the giant strides of Gov. Obiano.
She said that Anambra was the safest state in Nigeria with accessible good road network.
The PG said that although the community was grateful for the intervention by the state government, but stressed the need to ensure completion of the roads before the rainy season.
A stakeholder in Uruagu Nnewi, Mr Ben Aghazu pledged that the community would offer the construction company the needed support to complete the project.
In my personal capacity, I have provided a place of residence for the workers to ensure their availability in the site.
Aghazu commended Onyejepu efforts in ensuring that the state government intervened in 100-Foot Road, Nnewi.
Another stakeholder of the community, Mr Agu Okonkwo praised the Onyejepu for ensuring that the roads continued to command government’s attention.
He also said that the community was worried because the sand earlier coated on the roads was posing health challenges to residents of the community.
ADB TO BANKROLL CONSTRUCTION OF RURAL/FARM ROADS IN ANAMBRA AT PROJECT COST OF 50 MILLION DOLLARS
The African Development Bank (ADB) is to bankroll the construction of rural/farm roads in 14 Local Government Areas of Anambra state at the cost of 50 million dollars, a top aid of the Anambra state Government says.
The Project Coordinator of Anambra Rural Access and Agricultural Marketing Project (RAAMP), Mr Joe Onyejekwe, an engineer said the project would be sited in some select food producing corridors of the state.
According to him diligent decisions were reached to site the projects within these food producing belts of the state -- Ayamelum, Anambra East, Anambra West, Oyi, Dunukofia, Awka North, Awka, South, Orumba North, Orumba South, Aguata, Ihiala, Ogbaru, Idemili South and Anaocha.
He said the projects were originally conceived by the Federal Government, when it was established that the country was steadily losing 9.8 Billion dollars annually in post harvest losses.
The commissioner said this when the Association of Ndi Anambra residing in Madrid, Spain paid her courtesy visit in her office at the Jerome Udoji Secretariat Complex, Awka.
This stemmed from the inability of the food producing areas to readily access the markets to evacuate their harvests.
He said that the FG, then, opened up discussions with two major funding agencies -- the World Bank and the African Development based in Abidjan.
Onyejekwe, a Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Governor on Works, noted that it was the bid to overcome this anomaly that the FG then, projected to execute the jobs in 18 states.
He said that it was resolved that five states -- Anambra, Borno, Benue, Taraba and Cross River States would be financed by African Development Bank and the rest to be financed by the World Bank.
The ADB has since accepted to bankroll the projects, promising each of the five states 50 million dollars.
Their officials have made two major visits to Anambra State, during which they have interacted with people from the concerned communities.
They have all mutually agreed to work together toward successful realisation of the projects.
Onyejekwe, said that project, which aims primarily at building all-season farm roads would have complementing infrastructure and facilities like building of markets, Veterinary clinics, cottage industries, Road Safety Service centres, Storage facilities.
The benefitting communities benefiting communities would be trained on road maintenance and partnership with the private sector for provision of transport for evacuation of farm produce.
The job would also entail resettlement of people, who might be displaced in the process for project delivery.
He confirmed that Anambra State Government had demonstrated commitment by striving to meet all the local requirements to access the funding for the project.
Since conditions require that all participating states will provide 8 per cent of the counterpart funding, the state has since committed to this.
Indeed, the funding that has so far been utilised by Anambra to carry out its impact assessment studies and other relevant exercises considered important to assessing the project have come from the state Government.
Onyejekwe said that Anambra State Government had so far spent N80 million, all still within the 8 per cent of Anambra State share of the counterpart funding.
We expect another tranche of payment from Government to undertake another critical aspect of the job; this is the design and then full implementation of the project, when the funding must been assessed for full execution of the various jobs.
I am confident that the project will soon get off to a start with all the enormous engineering works in full steam.
The job execution would guarantee jobs at all levels – the Bank and communities will be happy at the jobs.
Its going to be a win on win situation for all’’.
DOZZY FOUNDATION ENROLLS 1,500 PERSONS INTO ANAMBRA HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME
Dozzy Foundation, a subsidiary of Dozzy Group Nig. Ltd. , has enrolled no fewer than 1,500 Okija indigenes into Anambra State Health Insurance Scheme (ASHIA).
, has enrolled no fewer than 1,500 Okija indigenes into Anambra State Health Insurance Scheme (ASHIA).
The enrollment took place at Okija General Hospital, where some top government officials, business moguls, traditional rulers, clergies and witnessed the event.
Gov. Willie Obiano of Anambra, who flagged off the exercise, was represented by his Deputy, Dr Nkem Okeke.
The governor said that the health insurance scheme was introduced to offer medical succour to the low income earners as well as those living in the rural areas of the state.
Obiano commended the Foundation for making free medical care available, noting that the scheme would enable the indigenes especially the elderly ones among them to visit the hospitals regularly.
He said that the enrollees would pay little or no amount in medical bills as the exercise would help to eliminate the spread and use of fake drugs in the communities.
We are here to extend the scheme to Okija through Dozzy Foundation,’’ he said.
The governor also inaugurated the upgraded Okija General Hospital by Dozzy Foundation.
He thanked the Executive Chairman Dozzy Group, Dr Daniel Chukwudozie for the kind gesture.
The governor, then, urged other well-to-do Ndi Anambra to emulate the group in bringing development to the state.
Executive Secretary ASHIA, Dr Simeon Onyemaechi, said Dozzy Foundation had taken the bull by the horn’ in engaging 1,500 persons into the scheme.
We wish to commend them for understanding the need for functional health system,’’ Onyemaechi said.
The ASHIA boss urged beneficiaries to ensure proper use of the opportunity.
Days of visiting quacks are over and the people of Okija can now access quality healthcare using their ASHIA cards,’’ Onyemaechi said.
He said that the foundation had taken care of financial aspect of the enrollees as N12, 000 annual fees per person had been paid for all 1,500 individuals.
Dr Onyemaechi also thanked Dozzy Foundation for spending millions of naira in renovating the Okija General Hospital, describing the act as philanthropy at its best’.
Anambra State Government is quite appreciative of the support from Dozzy group through its various interventions in Okija and environs,’’ he said.
In an address, Executive Chairman Dozzy group, Dr Chukwudozie said the foundation had over the years embarked on programmes aimed at empowering the less privileged.
These includes, offering scholarship to indigent students and putting smiles on faces of the widows.
He said that the Foundation had recognised inability of many people to pay their hospital bills.
This he said compel them to patronise quacks, thereby increasing the mortality rate of people living in most rural communities.
Dr Chukwudozie noted that the inauguration of the scheme in Okija in collaboration with ASHIA was in line with Social Corporate Responsibility of the Dozzy.
He solicited state government assistance in providing medical personnel, as well as equipping Okija General Hospital with necessary basic amenities.
Some of the enrollees expressed their joy, describing the programme as a good development that would help prolong their lives.
CRIMINALISE BUSH FIRES NOW -- LIVESTOCK FARMER
Dr Ugochukwu Okpalaeke, Managing Director (MD) Eagle Food Processing Industry Ltd., has called on government at all levels to criminalise bush fires to save forest reserves in the state.
Those who can afford it should pay without delay for their indigent relatives, friends and community members the way philanthropists like Dr Chukwudozie of Dozzy Foundation have done for their people.
Okpalaeke made the call while interacting with information officers, in his office at Ozalla Akokwa Umuchu, on Jan.
Dr Okpalaeke said that bush fires constituted sabotage against governments at all levels.
This is a matter that should be treated with dispatch.
He explained that that certain people he classed as lazy hunters’ were those in the habit of setting fires in a bid to hunt for bush meat’’ –rabbits, antelopes.
According to him in the process they only succeed in destroying forest reserves and their habitats.
When fires destroy bush, the nutrients in the land, animals, birds and insects that cross fertilize plants are also destroyed in the process; this also results into poor harvests of crops, high mortality rate among animals, with hunger as another direct consequence.
So, government has no option than to deal decisively with bush fire perpetrators, so as to stem negative consequences,’’ he said.
According to him, it is an ill wind that blows no one any good, calling on the media especially radio and television to develop jingles to sensitise the general public on dangers of bush fires.
He urged Churches, Primary/Secondary Schools, market leaders, Igwes, president’s generals and village heads to launch crusade against fire menace.
The MD said that since December 2019 to date, he lost nine native cows (Efi Igbo) as a result of bush fires that cleared all vegetations around his ranch.
The Efi Hausa is survives it because they eat prepared animal feeds while Efi Igbo finds it difficult to survive as feed mainly on green leaves,’’ he said.
Okpalaeke used the opportunity to congratulate Gov. Willie Obiano on his recent award as Knight Commander of the Pontifical Order of St. Gregory the Great.
There can hardly be a better demonstration of solidarity with the human family than participation in initiatives like the Anambra State Health Insurance Scheme.
Anambra State Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, Indigenous Artworks, Culture and Tourism, Mrs Sally Mbanefo has appealed Anambra State Association (ASA), Madrid, Spain to strive invest in the state.
This is an honour well deserved and a reward for hard work.
Obiano has achieved excellence at every life endeavour, from his school days to his days in the banking industry/personal businesses.
He called on Anambra youths to emulate Obiano, emphasising that award did not come through shortcuts, but rather from hard work.
If anybody wanted an award of excellence, he should discharge his duties creditably wherever they found themselves.
I have not less 40 awards as a farmer.
So, awards are available in every discipline; it is only hard work and sincerity of purpose that are rewarded,’’ he said.
The MD emphasised that it was better to rear animals in ranches than rearing them wandering about.
This he said had enabled them to grow faster, bigger and produce more.
Those that purchase cows from us testify to generating more meat as they slaughter them,’’ Okpalaeke said.
We maintain good relationship with crop farmers because we buy their products such as cassava peels, leaves, to feed our animals.
They also buy animal faeces as manure to grow crops.
Okpalaeke said that they also undertake palm kernel processing for animal feeds, buying as much as anybody could bring to them at attractive prices.
A staff member of Eagle Food Processing Industry Nigeria Ltd.
, Mr Samuel Ezennia said that their MD was a good employer.
He pays salaries promptly; maintains good relationship with workers who are known to be hard working.
He punishes lazy ones.
CONDUCT INTEGRITY TESTS BEFORE REBUILDING -- AGUPUGO URGES VICTIMS OF MARKET FIRE DISASTERS
Executive Director, Anambra State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr CY Agupugo has directed shop owners affected by Mgbuka Obosi Market fire disasters to conduct integrity tests before rebuilding their burnt shops.
Agupugo gave the directive when the panel set up on recent Mgbuka Obosi Market fires conducted assessment visits to affected parts of the market.
The executive director, who doubled as secretary of the panel noted that it was wrong to start rebuilding shops and malls without integrity tests by the State Physical Planning Board and other relevant bodies.
We all have to take proper measures before we commence rebuilding of shops.
I know that we are in a hurry to rebuild, so as to get back to our businesses, but we have to do the right thing first,’’ he said.
Managing Director Anambra State Fire Service, Mr Ben Chiobi noted that the market was of great relevance to Ndi Anambra, as investors from different parts of the world come there to do business.
According to him, it was of importance that challenges faced by the market be addressed immediately and accordingly.
Chiobi also condemned indiscriminate dumping of waste engine oil and other combustible materials in and around the market.
He said that state government through agencies like fire service, SEMA and related bodies would aid the market leaders to see that state laws would be enforce.
It is in the interest of government to see that whatever challenges they face are solved as the state government will always come to your aid.
In order to avoid future occurrence of disasters in the state, there is a process for erecting buildings and that process requires that you must get government approval,’’ Chiobi noted.
Chairman of Mgbuka Obosi who is also a member of the panel, Mr Samuel Okey Ezeobodo, while sympathising with the fire victims, commended the state government for showing concerns toward them.
He urged market leadership to ensure that the people put up better structures that would benefit the traders and government.

On June 12, 2018, Joshua Dariye, former Plateau State governor and senator, huddled in the dock awaiting the verdict of fate for pilfering N1.6bn public funds at a high court of the Federal Capital Territory.
Dariye was lachrymal, wiping hot tears from his eyes.
Before the senator was handed a 14-year jail sentence by Adebukola Banjoko, the presiding judge, he begged for mercy – a luxury he did not accord to the people of Plateau who endured his troubled administration.
He was found guilty of 14 counts out of the 23 preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
Before the judge passed her judgment, Paul Eroko, counsel to Dariye, pleaded for a light sentence.
“Appeals to your judgement do not succeed; we will fall on your mercy. The prisons are congested,” Eroko said.
“They misled the governor, it is the bank; they said he didn’t have to present anything.”
But Rotimi Jacobs, counsel to the EFCC, said Dariye did not deserve a light sentence because he “did not show remorse”.
At this point, weeping Dariye said he wanted to speak.
“Have mercy, you are a Christian, your name is Jacob,” he said.
On Thursday, Orji Uzor Kalu, another former governor and senator, received the retribution of kismet.
Reality jarred Kalu out of the fantasy that he was going home to his bed after his conviction for money laundering by a federal high court in Lagos.
After Mohammad Idris, the presiding judge, pronounced a 12-year jail sentence and warders moved towards him with handcuffs, the Senate Chief Whip resorted to diplomacy.
“Where are you taking us to now? Please don’t handcuff me. I will follow you,” he said.
Kalu’s fall is louder than the crash of Jericho – being a trenchant mouthpiece of President Muhammadu Buhari in the South-East.
But is his conviction a “pass mark” for Buhari’s much vaunted war against corruption? I do not think so.
First, the case is 12 years old. It was not actuated by this administration. And investigations were already concluded before this regime.
Second, corruption cases recently initiated against certain individuals have not received oomph owing to the fact that they are in the “Buhari fraternity”.
For example, the case of Babachir Lawal, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, is sputtering in court this despite his indictment by the government he served.
Also, there is a petition against Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the APC, for alleged money laundering at the EFCC. Tinubu admitted transporting cash in bullion vans on the eve of the 2019 election to his house. But the anti-graft agency has not moved a muscle to investigate the allegation.
When Ibrahim Magu, acting EFCC chairman, was asked about the petition against Jagaban by a journalist, he snubbed the inquiry, and said ‘’next question, please?’’
As a matter of fact, there are other members of the APC and those in the Buhari fraternity who have corruption allegations hanging on their necks, but the EFCC is yet to crack up a case against them.
I will not mention more names.
So, on what grounds should Buhari’s anti-corruption war be toasted? If the regime is applauded for the jailing of Dariye and Orji Kalu, how about other cases it has failed to take up or conclude?
The fact is, Buhari’s anti-corruption war is still selective. And as Abubakar Tsav, former Lagos police commissioner, said, “It has no impact on Nigerians.”
However, I will commend the judiciary for not bending despite influences to have some cases of corruption compromised. The termination of Kalu’s 12-year-old bout at the trial court is a big point for the institution. The hero here is this arm of government.
But beyond this feat, we must look into another tragic offence against Nigerians. Why is a senator convicted of fraud still receiving allowances and salaries as a member of the Senate?
As of December 2018, Dariye was paid N85.5m in prison, and as of May 2019 his allowances had risen to N171m. Obviously, the same immoral privilege will be accorded to Orji Kalu. Is this not troubling?
What it means is that tax-payers will continue to fund the lifestyles of individuals who have been convicted of stealing from them.
Justice is not final when people, who have been declared vandals of the public purse, are still maintained by public money.

ASUU Calls For Boycott As Varsites Begin IPPIS Today
The union said the Federal Government needs to test its own model of ensuring financial transparency rather than forcing its members captured on the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System, which opened on Monday.
The leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities has directed its members nationwide to disregard a circular from the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to enrol academic staff on the Integrated Payment and Personnel Information System from Monday.ASUU on Sunday stated that the same Accountant-General of the Federation had challenged the union to develop a template that accommodates the peculiarities of academic staff and present same to him.The union said the Federal Government needs to test its own model of ensuring financial transparency rather than forcing its members captured on the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System, which opened on Monday, a report by PUNCH said.Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, ASUU National President, added that the enrollment of lecturers was like taking universities back to core civil service.Ogunyemi insisted that its members will not take part in the registration for the IPPIS, adding that such steps by the Federal Government would undermine the autonomy of Nigerian universities.He said, “We have proposed to the government that we have an alternative that will address all issues that the government had raised about universities.“The government needs to test our own model rather than buying into a model that will take universities back to the core civil service. "With IPPIS, before a Vice Chancellor can employ an academic worker, the VC will have to get permission from the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.“Universities cannot be run within the framework of civil service bureaucracy. "Universities are universal cities of knowledge creation and they can perform best when they are allowed to operate their system based on the laws establishing them.“We signed a memorandum of action with government earlier this year and they promised that they will start visitation by March this year. Government didn’t do anything. This is November. When people say ASUU is encouraging corruption, it is cheap blackmail.“We will destroy Nigerian universities with IPPIS if government should go ahead and force people to enroll. "You can’t bring lecturers from all over the world and ask them to go and register in Abuja in the ministry. It is ridiculous. We have gone beyond that. They are taking us many decades back. It is sad.”
Banking Sector’s Loss Is Entertainment Industry’s Gain
The entertainment industry is emerging as the market that will absorbmuch of the loans the central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is forcingcommercial banks to give.A report by Proshare indicates that banks are positioning themselvesto attract clients from small and medium scale enterprises in themusic and movie space.However, analysts Sahara Reporters have spoken to and reportspublished by financial research firms, conclude that the increasedpressure on banks to lend much of their deposit, is negative for thefinance industry at this point.“We believe this development — the 65 percent loan to deposit ratio islargely negative for the banking sector, which has only just recoveredfrom the weak asset quality issues prevalent since 2016,”Cardinalstone research said in a report.“We also believe that the macro-environment is still too fragile tosupport strong growth in lending,” it added.Adedayo Bakare, an analyst with Afrinvest gave Sahara Reporters asimilar outlook. He said tier one banks – the most stable lenders, donot operate a banking model that allows them to give loans tocustomers that are highly likely not to pay back.This, however, are the type of customers the CBN wants the banks totarget. True to Bakare’s observation, two of the three-tier 1 lenders,Zenith and Guarantee Trust, are among the 12 lenders fined a combinedtotal of over N499bn by the CBN for their inability to meet with theSeptember 2019 target of borrowing 60 percent of their deposits to thereal sector. The third lender – Access bank, survived thanks to thehuge loan portfolio it inherited from Tier 2 Diamond bank.Proshare is of the opinion that these lenders have looked to thesafety of the celebrity industry, to reduce the risk of borrowingfunds to the everyday farmer and small-time shoemaker. In a reportpublished Thursday, it listed a series of creative packages DepositMoney Banks are adapting to build quality assets in the creativespace.The most audacious plan is Access bank’s Creative Arts village in OgunState. Proshare notes that the village will help to ‘address issueslike the location for movie production, capacity building forpractitioners, and deepening the ecosystem of the Arts andEntertainment industry in Nigeria.’Herbert wigwe, the managing director of Access Bank, expects thevillage to create 2 to 3m jobs annually. The size of Access bank’sinvestment in Ogun State is indicative of the feeling in the industry.Cardinalstone notes that commercial lenders will likely be ‘antsy intheir strategies to grow loans.’ The research firm is also of the viewthat the new measures are also likely to force banks to anxiouslyre-evaluate their loan growth Strategy.One of such strategies is the United Bank of Africa (UBA’s) decisionto make Wizkid its ambassador.It had also hosted a discourse "Stars and Suits: Afropop meets HighFinance," that conference gave UBA the opportunity to build acollaboration between music stars and finance institutions.Zenith, ECO Bank, and GT are other banks that have and are buildingmore partnerships with clientele in the creative industry.These moves are no doubt, attempts by banks to keep their assetsrelatively strong, under the climate of a policy analysts expect toweaken them.
Banky W Attacks Buhari's Government For Arresting Sowore
“Who go represent you? When they enter office, they will get what they paid for. Na double wahala for everybody.”
Musician, Bankole Wellington better known as Banky W, has condemned the Nigerian Government for its gross human rights violation against citizens.
He also accused Nigerians of being too complacent in moments when they should act.
Banky W made his position known in a music video posted on his Instagram page with hashtag #BetterChallenge.
He said, “You see the story is the same old one, you want change but you won't vote? Then complaining is a not the thing.
“Who go represent you? When they enter office, they will get what they paid for. Na double wahala for everybody.”
The video went on to show CCTV footage of Sowore's arrest by operatives of the Department of State Services in Lagos on August 3.
He added, “They arrest protestor and protect dishonourable senators. Who be the meat, who be the hunter? Too many days for the thief, one day for the owner.”"They arrest the Protestor, and protect dishonourable Senators".. time to dust off the mic.

BBNaija: Khafi Threatens To Sue The Sun Over "Damaging" Publication
The Sun had on Tuesday reported that Khafi, who is a PC with the Metropolitan Police, had been denied permission by the organisation to participate in the reality show.
The management of Khafi Kareem, a Big Brother Naija constant, has threatened to sue The Sun, a British tabloid, over what it considers "repulsive and damaging publication" about her.
This was contained in a statement released via Khafi's Instagram page.
Khafi, currently in the Big Brother reality TV show, became popular with viewers for her relationship and sexual activities with another housemate, Gedoni.
The Sun had on Tuesday reported that Khafi, who is a PC with the Metropolitan Police, had been denied permission by the organisation to participate in the reality show.
However, reacting to the report, Khafi's management said it is considering a legal option against the British tabloid except it publicly apologises and retract the now-viral report.
The statement read: “The attention of Khafi’s management has been drawn to a publication by The Sun UK on Tuesday, August 13, 2019, titled ‘LOIN OF DUTY Met Police ‘poster girl’ faces sack for ‘having sex’ on Nigerian Big Brother after being told not to take part’.
The brazen sensational and defamatory outburst by The Sun UK is written in poor taste without considering the ethics of journalism which seeks balance and objectivity.     At no time did The Sun UK send a mail of inquiry to Khafi’s official email which is blasted across her social media platforms under active management to confirm or refute the claims in the publication.
Khafi’s side of the story is deliberately and conveniently omitted to sell a pre-conceived narrative while responses from “outraged colleagues” and “other papers” riddle the publication.     This comes from a repressive culture of shaming and characterising women for their sexual decisions and life choices.
We find The Sun UK’s publication repulsive and damaging to the image and livelihood of our client.     We demand an immediate retraction of the publication by The Sun UK and a public apology to our client Khafilat Kareem within the next 48 hours.
Legal options are also being considered at this time.”     BBNaija Is Satanic, Says Muslim Group, Urges Christians To Join In Condemning Reality Show     “We are being forcibly dragged to a world of nudity, shamelessness and open promiscuity. Inmates of BBNaija kiss, romance and engage in sex openly. BBNaija is Bohemian, anti-social, crude and immoral. It constitutes a potent danger to every home. BBNaija is Satanic. It is unacceptable.
The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has urged the federal government to immediately place a ban on the Big Brother Naija show.
MURIC posited that the reality show promotes immorality in the country branding it as ‘immoral, dangerous and Bohemian’.
Professor Ishaq Akintola, Director of MURIC also said the promoter of the show must be held accountable for promoting immorality in the country
“We are being forcibly dragged to a world of nudity, shamelessness and open promiscuity. Inmates of BBNaija kiss, romance and engage in sex openly. BBNaija is Bohemian, anti-social, crude and immoral. It constitutes a potent danger to every home. BBNaija is Satanic. It is unacceptable.
“Where are our norms and values? Is it part of African culture to engage in sex in the open? Where are the authorities? Is the Ministry of Information and Culture sleeping? Is the National Orientation Agency on sabbatical? Who will protect our children from this despicable onslaught? Who did this to Nigeria?
“This reality show is dragging our children into a life of moral debauchery. It is robbing them of the last vestiges of honour. It is deleting the word ‘shame’ from their vocabulary. BB Naija has alienated our youth from the elders. A yawning lacuna now exists between the young and the old. Irreversible social crisis looms.
“We must see those who woo our young ones with humongous amounts of money, big cars, and palatial buildings as those bent on destroying industry, diligence, and integrity, particularly among the youth. Nothing destroys a nation faster than materialism. The daughters of Jezebel are here already. Unless the authorities move with the speed of lightning, human dignity in Nigeria is going, going, going!
“Or do we not realize that for every single BB Naija inmate who wins a big amount of money and a car, more than 50 million young people are misled? Qur’an 30:41 says, ‘Evil has appeared on both land and sea as a result of the handiworks of men…’ The Bible in Ephesians 4:19 was also describing these people when it says, ‘Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.’”
MURIC calls for unity among the Christians and Muslims in the country to jointly condemn and force the government to place a ban on the reality show.

“We can put an end to this anomaly called BB Naija if Christians and Muslims bury the hatchet and come together to fight evil. Home is home. Moral debauchery knows no religion. The destructive influence of television shows like BB Naija penetrates both Christian and Muslim homes.
“Ditto for the custodians of our culture and tradition. Our traditional rulers ignore a program like this, which has all the potentials to diminish the dignity of our culture. They are fighting over who should be chairman of the council of traditional rulers. They want to be the king of kings and rivals of the supreme creator. Who placed a curse on Nigeria?
“Homo sapiens may not respect a single snake when they see one. But can anyone wait to see what follows if the cobra leads and it is faithfully followed by the python, the black mamba, rattlesnake, garter snake, and the anaconda? So what do you think will happen if our traditional rulers from the East, West and North march on Aso Rock to demand the immediate halt of this horrible show?"
MURIC charged the Ministry of Information and Culture to move swiftly against BB Naija before moral debauchery becomes Nigeria’s middle name.
Big Brother Naija: Nigerian-born British Policewoman, Khafi Kareem, Faces Being Sacked After 'Sex Romp' With Another Contestant
The officer was used as a 'poster girl' for the Met, posing alongside Met Commissioner Cressida Dick to encourage black and female recruitment and celebrate 100 years of women in the force.
A British policewoman faces the sack for defying her bosses to appear a reality television programme - before appearing to sleep with a man on the show.
PC Khafi Kareem, 29, from the Metropolitan Police, was warned not to take part in Nigerian Big Brother this year.
But she was granted unpaid leave and entered the show, in which she has formed a relationship with fellow contestant Ekpata Gedoni, 31, the Sun reported.
Audiences in Nigeria have been caught up in their liaisons, of which there has been three, but she will now be the subject of an investigation by the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards.
And her colleagues have expressed their dismay at her 'tarnishing' the force's reputation with her antics.
The officer was used as a 'poster girl' for the Met, posing alongside Met Commissioner Cressida Dick to encourage black and female recruitment and celebrate 100 years of women in the force.
One colleague told the Sun: "She's a serving British police officer - it's outrageous. She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway. Her out-of-office email reply blatantly says that she is away from work, yet no one does anything.
Other officers working with her are furious that she can just disobey orders then swan off Africa and tarnish the reputation of the force.
Ms. Kareem began as a PC at Lambeth station in 2015 after four years spent as a part-time special constable.
The officer, who has spoken against stop-and-search, joined up after a 16-year-old friend was stabbed to death, UK Daily Mail reports.
The PC worked as a spotter at airports, looking for possible victims of female genital mutilation (FGM). She also acted as a translator as she speaks French, Italian and her native Yoruba. However, she wasmoved from the FGM team after she argued with colleagues.
Publicity material for the programme showed Miss Kareem in her uniform, branding her a talented singer and dancer.
The material says of Miss Kareem: 'Police officer Khafi Kareem believes that you can have it all if you believe in yourself.
She is not only hoping to win the prize money but she wants the exposure that being in Big Brother Naija House brings so that she can do societal good.'
Her romance with Mr. Gedoni has been gripping viewers of the show, which began on June 30.
Nigerian news websites published footage of the couple appearing to be in an act of congress beneath the sheets.
One article said: "There are now fears that Khafi may leave Big Brother Naija House pregnant as she and lovebird Gedoni continued their sizzling romance. The cameras caught them for the third time overnight as other housemates were dead asleep. The footage, now trending, showed the lovebirds moving their bodies in ecstasy under the sheets. Gedoni and Khafi first romped in the house on Saturday, July 20 and then again on Tuesday, July 23."
Her participation has left her fellow officers unimpressed. Another Met source told the Sun: "There should be no way back for her from this and her superiors will have to act.
She fitted the mould perfectly for how the modern force wants to portray itself but seems to have got a bit too big for her boots.     'It's hard to see how can she argue that she hasn't brought the force into disrepute.'     A Met spokesman said last night: The Met does not support the officer's appearance nor does she represent the Met whilst appearing on the show.
All officers have a duty to behave with professionalism and in a manner that does not bring the Met into disrepute whether on or off duty.     Those who do not behave professionally risk breaching police standards of professional behaviour, and may be dealt with by way of misconduct proceedings."
Big Brother Naija: Sex Content On Reality Show Contemptible, Says Women Council
A new Big Brother Naija is on its way coming and we are working with Startimes. We are doing BBN that will reflect the true Nigerian culture.
The National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) and the Nigerian government have condemned the sexual content on Big Brother Naija (BBN), a reality TV show, stating that it is not a Nigerian culture.
Segun Runsewe, Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), said this while receiving Gloria Shoda, President of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS).
The NCAC boss also revealed that the government was in talks with Startimes to start a state-owned BBN that will truly reflect Nigerian content.
He also warned that the agency would present a nudity bill to punish sexual acts as displayed on BBN.
He said: “We are going to re-present that bill. You can’t fight a battle without a legal framework; we are definitely going to be conscious of that.
“I will take up the issue of Big Brother Naija. I have spoken with officials of the National Broadcasting Commission because what is going on now is terrible. Having love affairs on the screen is not part of our own culture at all.
“Let me use this forum to tell Nigerians that a new Big Brother Naija is on its way coming and we are working with Startimes. We are doing BBN that will reflect the true Nigerian culture. We are already working on it, all that will be eaten there will be Nigerian food, the dresses will be Nigerian dresses.”
The NCWS president said she was not against the BBN reality show but the sex content was disgusting.
Shoda said, “Having live sex on stage is the thing affecting my sensibility and it is impacting negatively on the young children coming up. Does it mean that they can’t abstain from sex for three months? I’m condemning the sex content on BBN.”
Big Brother Naija Star, Khaffy, Facing UK Met Police Internal Inquiry For Joining Show Without Permission
“She’s a serving British police officer — it’s outrageous. She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway.”
A Metropolitan Police officer, Khafi Kareem, is appearing on the Nigerian version of Big Brother despite being refused permission by her bosses and could face disciplinary action.
Ms. Kareem, 29, who was pictured alongside Commissioner Cressida Dick as the Met celebrated 100 years of women in the force last November, is one of the stars of the African reality TV show.
Scotland Yard said it had not granted Ms. Kareem’s request to appear on the programme and that an internal investigation would be carried out, reports UK Press Association.
The UK Metropolitan Police said Ms. Kareem was granted unpaid leave for an “unrelated reason” ahead of appearing on the show but her request to take part in the programme was denied.A spokesman said: “A Pc, attached to the Met’s transformation command, requested permission to take part in a reality television entertainment show in Nigeria. Permission was not given.“The Met is aware that the officer has since appeared on the show without authority.
“The Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed and will be carrying out an investigation into the circumstances.
“The Met does not support the officer’s appearance nor does she represent the Met whilst appearing on the show.”
The force added that any officer found to have breached police standards of professional behaviour could face misconduct proceedings.
According to The Sun, Ms. Kareem joined the force as a Pc based at Lambeth station in 2015, having worked part-time as a special constable for four years.
An unnamed colleague told the newspaper: “She’s a serving British police officer — it’s outrageous. She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway.”
A post on the website of Africa Magic, the television channel which broadcasts Big Brother Naija, says Ms. Kareem joined the show “so that she can do societal good”.
It read: “Police officer Khafi Kareem believes that you can have it all if you believe in yourself.
“She is not only hoping to win the prize money but she wants the exposure that being in Big Brother Naija House brings so that she can do societal good.
“What people don’t know about her is that she is secretly talented in spoken word, singing, and dancing. She is an Ekiti native who resides in London.”
The post also reveals Ms. Kareem would spend the prize money, reportedly worth N30 million (£68,000), on hosting a travel show in Nigeria, as well as investing in charitable causes.
Bigamy: ASD Daughter's Marriage, Mulan and Abubakar Musa Abubakar By Dr Muhammad Bashir Maru
We must not forget the reverberating cry of Ernesto Che Guevera to wit ''If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine'' it is this that spur true patriots on an eternal vigil as the vanguards for justice and equity for all.
Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.'' – Benjamin Franklin
From the very origins and cradle of humanity, injustice has always reared its ugly head to crush and oppress those perceived to be of less social standing and thus the fight for justice has raged on through the ages. Little wonder the immortal words of Benjamin Franklin remain as empirically practicable today as it was decades ago when he muttered them and even before the words found life from his oscillating tongue centuries back. These pricking words are the prods that guide us today as we cry out for impartial justice for Abubakar Musa Abubakar who is being persecuted consistently by Alhaji Sani Dauda (ASD), former Chairman of Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited.
In the Nigeria of yesteryears opulent individual like ASD lorded over others like a czar of a medieval fiefdom; having their wishes, whims and caprices foisted on the generality of the people. This was indeed a dark and gloomy period when he and his ilk had their words as laws and any attempt to challenge or oppose their ambition would be seen as a sacrilege with a resultant mobilization of their foot soldiers to bully, coarse, harass, intimidate and humiliate those who dared to oppose them. In these repugnant dark days, it was believed that some rogue law enforcement agents, compromised media influencers and corrupt judges were whispered to be on his payroll and always willing to do his bidding. It can thus be inferred that was the very reason his types got away with so much impunity.
Though the businessman still wallows in the euphoria of the past, but what he has failed to realize is that the ground has shifted beneath him, and that in the New Nigeria of today no one is above the law.
In the lines of the ancient adage; ''A leopard never changes its spots'' and so true for ASD's apparent impunity which has remerged in this recent episode hence the resort to contempt of Court and judicial abuse all in a bid to placate his daughter Nasiba Sani Dauda, shield his Son Shehu Sani Dauda, a sharia court Judge Alkali Murtala Nasir Al-Misiry and one Abdullahi Kaloma. Together, they jointly committed criminal conspiracy, abetment of an offence, criminal assault, wrongful confinement and restraint, false imprisonment, voluntary causing of harm, enticement of a married woman, bigamy, re-marriage with concealment of former marriage in defiance of an existing judgment of the Kawo Upper Sharia Court, Kaduna in a case between Abubakar Musa Abubakar Vs. Nasiba Sani Dauda contrary to sections 45, 46, 58, 217, 229, 230, 239, 365, 366 and 369 respectively of the panel code law of Kaduna State, Nigeria.
As one would expect that his recent entanglement with Abubakar Musa Abubakar a supposed son-in-law is nothing new and certainly he is not likely going to be the last person to undergo such a harrowing experience from irresponsible prying except the businessman is stopped in his tracks by the grilling mechanism of justice.
Now, the same scenario is being re-enacted with Abubakar Musa Abubakar, who married Nasiba Sani Dauda on the 24th December, 2016. It will be recalled that the marriage started on the foundation of love, peace and harmony until few months into the marriage when the father of Nasiba - Alhaji Sani Dauda - began undue interference in the family affairs of the couple on a daily basis and subsequently instructed his daughter against her will to abscond from the marriage for reasons not yet clear to discerning minds. All entreaties to ASD to return Nasiba to her matrimonial home fell on deaf ears, but he instead forced Nasiba to institute a case of Khul' (request for divorce) before Grade 1 Sharia Court, Tudun Wada, Kaduna where a controversial judgment was obtained and a dissolution of the marriage was pronounced without recourse to principles of nemo iudex in causa sua and audi alteram partem to the concerned parties.
However, Abubakar Musa Abubakar not satisfied with the judgment of the lower court obtained a stay of execution order from the Upper Sharia Court, Kawo, Kaduna which was served on the respondent and subsequently appealed the travesty of justice of the lower court at the Upper Sharia Court which gave judgment in favour Abubakar Musa Abubakar by quashing and setting aside the judgment of the lower court for lacks of jurisdiction. Both the stay of execution order notice and the substantive judgment of the Upper Sharia Court were properly served on the respondent (Nasiba). It is the only prevailing judgment that exists till this day.
The arrest and detention of Alhaji Sani Dauda and others for abetment of an offence, remarriage with marriage concealment, criminal assault among other charges goes further to show that President Muhammadu Buhari's next level agenda will not tolerate lawlessness from any quarters and that justice is truly blind but fair and balanced to all manner of people. The action of ASD is capable of triggering series of unpleasant events such breach to peace, chaos, turmoil etc. Above all it is an affront to the judiciary, rule of law and attempt to denigrate sharia law. How can anyone who called himself Muslim marry off another man's wife?
In condemning the injustice and high handedness being propelled by ASD, let this turn of justice signal a warning knell to all that; gone are the days when individuals because of their economic powers can do as they wish by pocketing law enforcement officers and conniving with rogues members of the judiciary to do as they please. His arrest and detention has sent an unmistakable warning to unrepentant law breakers that there is now a new Sherriff in town and that their excesses will no longer be tolerated. All eyes are now on the judiciary on whether they will look the other way while the temple of justice is being desecrated through repeated abuse of judicial processes and contempt of Court proceedings.
Since the outbreak of this imbroglio and its escalation in the public domain, ASD albeit clandestinely has been sponsoring groups and individuals as face-saving measures to sell false narratives through media propaganda that portray him and his darling daughter as the victims rather than the perpetrators of this heinous crime against God and humanity. One of such groups is Muslim Lawyers Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State Chapter, an organisation that should be neutral in a matter that involves two contending parties both of who are Muslims or at best side with the truth but instead they came out disgracefully to pitch tent with the culprits (ASD and Others) who intentionally and knowingly desecrate Islamic Sharia laid down tenets of marriage by abetting bigamy. By this act, MULAN Kaduna State chapter has shown that their conscience is available for auction to the highest bidder, how low can an organization sink that prides itself as noble?
Abubakar Musa Abubakar should be applauded by all and sundry for towing the path of honour in seeking redress and restraining his relations, associates and thousands of followers from taking laws into their hand and for his abiding faith in our country's judicial system. Abubakar has never been accused of any wrong doing and he is well known as an honest, hardworking and unassuming gentleman who cannot even hurt a fly. In the face of provocation, intimidation, emotional hurt, blackmail, unwarranted media attack, defamation, criminal assault to relatives and threat to life among others, Abubakar Musa Abubakar has remained unmoved and consistently determined to get justice via the constitutionally guaranteed means.
Let’s hope that at the end of it all, justice will be served impartially, because anything other than that will be equal to encouraging self-help, stamping of lawlessness and an unequivocal invitation to disorderliness. A society that gives justice to only selected few is a fertile ground for anarchy. Let those who have ears take a heed.
We must not forget the reverberating cry of Ernesto Che Guevera to wit ''If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine'' it is this that spur true patriots on an eternal vigil as the vanguards for justice and equity for all.

Bill To Give More Money To Lawmakers Passes Second Reading
The zonal intervention funds used in executing constituency projects by the lawmakers has been marred with cases of corruption.
Many of the projects are shoddily executed or abandoned.
In some cases, lawmakers use the items to boost their campaigns.
Nigerian lawmakers are in the process of passing a bill that will allocate more money to them for constituency projects.
The zonal intervention funds used in executing constituency projects by the lawmakers has been marred with cases of corruption.
Many of the projects are shoddily executed or abandoned.
In some cases, lawmakers use the items to boost their campaigns.
However, at the plenary on Tuesday, lawmakers passed a bill seeking to allocate 20 per cent of the national budget for constituency projects.
According to Premium Times, the bill was sponsored by Stella Odua, lawmaker representing Anambra North.
This bill comes on the heels of the outcry over non-existent and incomplete constituency projects proposed by lawmakers.
Nigerian lawmakers have been accused of using constituency projects as a means of embezzling public funds.
Only recently, President Muhammadu Buhari said billions of naira allocated to constituency projects had not been properly utilised – an allegation that the Senate Minority Leader dismissed as erroneous.
According to the bill, projects under the Act when passed shall be community-based in order to ensure that the prospective benefits are available to a wide cross-section of the inhabitants of a particular area.
It also states that any funding under the Act shall be for a completed project or a defined phase of a project and may include the acquisition of land and buildings.
“All projects shall be projects as defined under this Act when passed and may include costs related to feasibility studies, planning and design or other technical input for the project but shall not include recurrent costs of a facility.
“Projects may include the acquisition of vehicles, machinery and other equipment for the constituency,” are some provisions of the bill.
Leading the debate, Oduah said constituency projects is one of the unique features of Nigeria’s democratic journey so far.
She said the bill is intended to correct the top-bottom approach of governance and replace it with the bottom-top approach.
If not for the projects, the majority of federal constituencies would not have a single federal project due to the lopsided nature of project allocation in the budget, she said.
In his contribution, Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, said there are lots of misinterpretations and misinformation on constituency projects hence the need to act in a manner that gives every constituency a sense of belonging and a national feeling.
He said, “I think it is only very fair to ensure that every part of this country has that sense of belonging, those little interventions as democratic dividends."
Bobrisky Is Risky, Buhari Regime Warns Travellers, Tourists
The health hazard Bobrisky has is worse than Ebola Virus Disease; travellers and tourists should be careful wherever they notice the presence of Bobrisky, mostly as it affects sharing of public facilities.
The President Muhammadu regime has warned tourists and travellers to be wary of Nigerian crossdresser, Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, aka Bobrisky.
Reacting to a complaint that Bobrisky used a female restroom at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Nigeria's Director-General of National Centre for Arts and Culture, Segun Runsewe, told Punch, “Bobrisky is a serious health hazard for Nigeria and Nigerians. The health hazard Bobrisky has is worse than Ebola Virus Disease; travellers and tourists should be careful wherever they notice the presence of Bobrisky, mostly as it affects sharing of public facilities.
“Women are prone to get various types of disease from the toilet than sexual intercourse. Now, Bobrisky will enter the same toilet with a woman and at the end the woman will contract some kind of diseases.
“When she gets home and sleeps with her husband and the husband discovers he has been infected, the next thing is to seek for divorce without knowing the actual cause of how the wife was infected.”
Speaking further, he said, “In the first place, Bobrisky’s passport shows that he is a man. Why should he turn himself to a woman and use women’s toilets? At the end of the day, innocent Nigerian women who go to same toilet will now be infected with what they did not bargain for.
“If Bobrisky is even using men’s toilet, we can understand. As I speak, we got a report of how a woman was very upset with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria because on this day she saw Bobrisky using female toilet in Abuja airport.
“Well, for me, we have done our little bit; we have left everything for the medical practitioners.”

Border Closure: Nigeria's Inflation Dropped Despite Measure, Says National Bureau Of Statistics
According to the bureau, the rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of oils and fats, meat, bread and cereals, potatoes, yam, and other tubers and fish.
Nigeria Cameroon border
Nigeria's inflation rate has dropped by 0.06 in the last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.
According to the Consumer Price Index, the inflation rate dropped from 11.08 percent in July to 11.02 percent in August.
The NBS said that the drop in inflation rate continued in August despite several pronouncements regarding restrictions on the import of some food items, minimum wage, and the recent border closures.
Similarly, food inflation dropped to 13.17% from 13.39%, while core inflation dropped to 8.68% from 8.80% recorded in the previous month.
With respect to the impact of border closure on consumer prices, the bureau stated that the country may not see the significant effect on inflation now as the closure was only captured for 11 days during the 31 days reference period in August.
According to the bureau, the rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of oils and fats, meat, bread and cereals, potatoes, yam, and other tubers and fish.
On a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index increased by 1.22% in August 2019, down by 0.04% points from 1.26% recorded in July 2019.
Boris Johnson Wins Parliamentary Majority
The exit poll spells disaster for the main opposition Labour Party, which was projected to win just 191 seats – its worst result since 1935.
British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has won a parliamentary majority following an election to determine the next phase of Brexit.
According to Sky News and BBC on Friday, the results show that the Tories won 326 of the 650 seats in the lower House of Commons, meaning they could not be beaten.
Exit polls from Thursday’s vote indicated they could win 368 seats.
If confirmed, this would be the party’s biggest majority in three decades.
By contrast, the exit poll spells disaster for the main opposition Labour Party, which was projected to win just 191 seats – its worst result since 1935.
On Friday, European leaders are expected to charge EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, with negotiating a close trade deal with Britain.
The News Agency of Nigeria explained that with a large majority of MPs, Johnson will be able to get the divorce deal he struck with Brussels through parliament in time to meet the next Brexit deadline of January 31.
Borno Governor, Zulum, Assents To Bill To Regulate NGOs Activities In State
Zulum said that the bill will empower the agency in the coordination of humanitarian agencies and development partners in the state.
Borno State governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, has passed the state’s Agency for Coordination of Development and Humanitarian Response bill into law to regulate the activities of Non-Governmental Organisations as well as development partners in the state.

“This will be in line with state government’s stabilisation and recovery objectives across the 27 local government areas of the state.”
Earlier in his remarks, Speaker of Borno State House of Assembly, Abdulkarim Lawan, said that the bill will go a long way in assisting displaced persons through the coordination of humanitarian and developmental activities in the state.
Brazen Invasion Of Court By DSS And Lagos State Task Force: Suggestions For The Bar By Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa
Unless we act swiftly and urgently now, there seems to be more ahead in the coming days.
I commend the leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association for its prompt response to the court invasion by the DSS. The statement issued is very encouraging and timely indeed. That is what is expected, given that the main objective of the NBA is to promote the rule of law.
I suggest the following further steps: 1. A meeting with the CJN and AGF to consult on possible steps to be taken to protect judges and the courts from further invasion. As it was happening in Abuja, so also was it happening in the Federal High Court in Lagos where it was reported that members of the Lagos State Environmental Task Force stormed the court and even stabbed an officer of the court.
The purpose of this meeting is to secure the courts with a functional police post as is done in the National Assembly and even houses of assembly of the states.
2. To ensure that the DSS is made to account for the events of December 6, 2019.
3. To also meet with the leadership of the National Assembly, the committees on judiciary and human rights and law enforcement with a view to getting the DSS to be brought to book.
4. To demand the immediate disengagement of the present leadership of the DSS and all its officers involved in the invasion.
5. To meet with the AG of Lagos State to unravel the invasion of Lagos court and bring those involved to book.
6. To visit CJ of Federal High Court and Hon Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu for solidarity and consultations.
Henceforth, let the NBA get its members involved in any government to be held accountable for any breach of the rule of law by the government and its officers and agencies.
In any state where there is glaring disobedience of the order of court or brazen infraction of the constitution, the AG of that state should be referred to the LPDC and if he’s a SAN, also to the LPPC.
The same should happen to the AGF when it involves the Federal Government and its agencies.
Then the counsel involved in such cases for the government should be held accountable by the NBA and the bar generally and be suspended forthwith.
Unless we act swiftly and urgently now, there seems to be more ahead in the coming days.

Liverpool, Barcelona, Juventus Record Remarkable Wins As Arsenal’s Misery Continues
For example, in the widely followed English Premier League, table toppers – Liverpool – fought a resilient Crystal Palace team to walk away 2-1 winners at the end of 90 minutes to keep their title hopes alive.
In major European football league matches played on Saturday, spectators and viewers around the world including in Nigeria were treated to all sorts of experience – good, bad and ugly.
For example, in the widely followed English Premier League, table toppers – Liverpool – fought a resilient Crystal Palace team to walk away 2-1 winners at the end of 90 minutes to keep their title hopes alive.
Goals from Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino delivered the maximum points for Jurgen Klopp’ side after Wilfried Zaha had scored an equaliser late in the second half.
In other parts of England, Leicester City where Nigeria’s Wilfred Ndidi is an integral member of the team, thrashed Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 courtesy of goals from Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy.
But it was a different story for Arsenal Football Club of London as their troubles on the pitch continued on Saturday after they were held to a draw at home by Southampton.
The result could have been worse for Unai Emery’s side had the visitors converted all their chances inside the 18-yard box.
It took the artistry of Alexandre Lacazette late in extra-time to score the equalising goal for Arsenal and grab a point for them.
Following the team’s poor performance in recent times, Emery had come under intense pressure with many of the fans already losing faith in him and his ability to deliver long-awaited success after the departure of Arsene Wenger last season.
In Spain and Italy, Barcelona and Juventus both ground out important wins away from home against Laganes and Atalanta respectively despite strong resistance from their opponents.
Goals from Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 win over the host team while a double from Gonzalo Higuain and one from Paulo Dybala saw Juventus come from behind to emerge victorious.
Most top sides in Europe’s biggest football leagues were all busy on Saturday as a result of the resumption of the Champions League and Europa League between Tuesday and Thursday.

Man Who Staged Wedding Without Reception Reveals How He Convinced Family To Support Idea
Speaking with SaharaReporters on Tuesday, Yusuf, said that the decision was one of the biggest he ever took in his life.
A new groom, Adewale Yusuf, who recently shocked many Nigerians by indicating on his wedding invitation card that there would be no reception after the ceremony, has told SaharaReporters that it took him only two calls to convince his parents and other family members to buy into his idea.
Though he said it was initially tough to persuade his bride, Blessing, to support the concept, he eventually won her over after a few debates on the issue.
The new couple trended last weekend on the social media with many Nigerians applauding and also bashing their decision not to hold a reception for their guests.
Speaking with SaharaReporters on Tuesday, Yusuf, said that the decision was one of the biggest he ever took in his life.
He said, “When I first informed my parents of the idea not to have a reception after my wedding ceremony, they dropped the call on me.
“Eventually, it took me about two more calls to be able to convince them to support my idea.
“The truth is that I’m a man of my words. I’m a different person, I am not a loud type.
“Many people around me did not like the idea initially but I made sure to let them see reasons with me.
“At the end of the day, everyone appreciated my idea.”
But despite not staging a reception at their wedding, Yusuf told SaharaReporters that many of their guests didn’t return home without having something to eat.
He added, “We shared food for the few friends we invited. I made sure my friends that came from Ibadan went back that day.
“One thing people should know is that there is nothing they want that they can’t do as long as it makes them happy and fulfilled.
“Having a loud reception after the wedding ceremony was unnecessary as far as I was concerned.”

Ministerial Clutching At Straws By Barnabas Igho
For now, let him know that his take-off was very bad and turbulent and everything boils down to his poor piloting skills, and not the army of imaginary saboteurs and enemies his aides are busy conjuring up for him.
If you are supervising an important ministry like that of communication even without the recent fancy addition of “digital economy” to its name, and you still need a spokesperson to pen almost 2,000 words of polemics in order to project your image, then your self-inflicted trouble is just starting in my reckoning.
Before her latest outburst in the media, thoughtlessly blaming imaginary saboteurs for trying to stop her ‘unstoppable boss’, Uwa Suleman had issued a disconcerting diatribe in form of a press release, accusing all critical stakeholders of the ministry her principal supervises including the media, of ganging up against him because he was the ‘best thing’ that happened to the industry since its liberalisation in the year 2000. This prompted ripostes of some respected columnists like Mr Sanya Oni of The Nation newspaper, who eloquently summed up the minister’s tragedy as a case of exaggerated notion of the office that he occupies as “he obviously didn’t think that his remit stops at formulating and implementing policies for the digital economy; as he wants to play the regulator”.
Since his assuming office in August this year, Mr Pantami has indeed found it difficult to adjust from the regulatory role he used to enjoy at National Information Technology Development Agency to his new titular position as per regulating the industry is concerned, and his unconstitutional attempts to dabble into it has invited the resistance of major actors in the industry like Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria as well as that of the Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria.
Coming back to Uwa’s latest invectives however, there are some fundamental half-truths she raised in her slay-queen styled article, like ridiculous claim that South Africa and other countries are busy copying and pasting the minister’s example of his failed data price reduction directive. While this, to say the least, is very disrespectful to the authorities in South Africa, who have never impliedly referred to Nigeria in taking their decisions, it’s obviously not the actual representation of the truth of the matter.
Someone should wake Uwa up and hand over a mug of coffee to her together with the contrasting news of India’s example that hiked data prices to as much as 40 per cent. We don’t know how this is ignored as a copy and pasting of what the policy of the man she obsequiously describes in ludicrous adjectives that late Idi Amin of Uganda would have rejected. To cut the story short, India used to enjoy the cheapest data in the world, but the industry could no longer sustain it without risking losing in further investment to support the telecom infrastructure in the country. This still happened within the 21-day coincidence Uwa claimed to have provided the copy and paste effect in South Africa.u hụ
Still, what Uwa hasn’t told us was that South Africa used to be among the top three in terms of the cost of data and even with 50 per cent reduction, it wouldn’t come down to the level of Nigeria despite the fact that the challenges the telcos face and cost of production in Nigeria are clearly on a different scale. Even on the strength of TheCable report that Pantami quoted in the past, it put Nigeria and South Africa, with the average of $2.22 and $7.19 per 1GB respectively. And one can forgive Uwa for her poor grasp of the issue as she embarrassingly attributed the directive in South Africa to the country’s telecom regulator, while a little search on Google on the matter would have told her that the decision emanated from South Africa Competition Regulatory Authority, not the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and the decision must have been scientifically based, not jejune subjective populist directive.
But such kinds of faux pas are understandable as Uwa and co in the new mandate are trying to learn the rope. And they should be reminded of the fact that before their arrival on the scene, the industry had already matured. There were over 70 million Nigerians on the high-speed Internet, millions of active subscriber base as well as numerous sensational story in the industry, which has been on this sustained trajectory for long. Hence, accusing both the providers and regulator of connivance is not only reckless but cheap as both the stakeholders collaboratively built the industry from the scratch. Some years ago, we saw how the regulator, NCC fined a major MNO over N1trn. Pray what kind of compromised regulator would dare?
It’s not too late for the minister however, to curb himself of this seduction to ‘populism’ and court the important stakeholders of the ministry by beginning to put the cart before the horse – addressing industry issues – if he wants to succeed.
Omobola Johnson was very effective as a minster because she fully understood the job and how to manage a delicate industry like telecommunications. If Mr Pantami wants to succeed, he needs all the regulators and operators on his side, and he can’t achieve that by constantly pitching them against the consumers thereby making his narcissistic self-good and everybody that has contributed to the development of the industry bad.
For now, let him know that his take-off was very bad and turbulent and everything boils down to his poor piloting skills, and not the army of imaginary saboteurs and enemies his aides are busy conjuring up for him.
Igho, a telecoms engineer cum public affairs analyst, writes from Lagos.
If you are supervising an important ministry like that of communication even without the recent fancy addition of “digital economy” to its name, and you still need a spokesperson to pen almost 2,000 words of polemics in order to project your image, then your self-inflicted trouble is just starting in my reckoning.
Before her latest outburst in the media, thoughtlessly blaming imaginary saboteurs for trying to stop her ‘unstoppable boss’, Uwa Suleman had issued a disconcerting diatribe in form of a press release, accusing all critical stakeholders of the ministry her principal supervises including the media, of ganging up against him because he was the ‘best thing’ that happened to the industry since its liberalisation in the year 2000. This prompted ripostes of some respected columnists like Mr Sanya Oni of The Nation newspaper, who eloquently summed up the minister’s tragedy as a case of exaggerated notion of the office that he occupies as “he obviously didn’t think that his remit stops at formulating and implementing policies for the digital economy; as he wants to play the regulator”.
Since his assuming office in August this year, Mr Pantami has indeed found it difficult to adjust from the regulatory role he used to enjoy at National Information Technology Development Agency to his new titular position as per regulating the industry is concerned, and his unconstitutional attempts to dabble into it has invited the resistance of major actors in the industry like Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria as well as that of the Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria.
Coming back to Uwa’s latest invectives however, there are some fundamental half-truths she raised in her slay-queen styled article, like ridiculous claim that South Africa and other countries are busy copying and pasting the minister’s example of his failed data price reduction directive. While this, to say the least, is very disrespectful to the authorities in South Africa, who have never impliedly referred to Nigeria in taking their decisions, it’s obviously not the actual representation of the truth of the matter.
Someone should wake Uwa up and hand over a mug of coffee to her together with the contrasting news of India’s example that hiked data prices to as much as 40 per cent. We don’t know how this is ignored as a copy and pasting of what the policy of the man she obsequiously describes in ludicrous adjectives that late Idi Amin of Uganda would have rejected. To cut the story short, India used to enjoy the cheapest data in the world, but the industry could no longer sustain it without risking losing in further investment to support the telecom infrastructure in the country. This still happened within the 21-day coincidence Uwa claimed to have provided the copy and paste effect in South Africa.
Still, what Uwa hasn’t told us was that South Africa used to be among the top three in terms of the cost of data and even with 50 per cent reduction, it wouldn’t come down to the level of Nigeria despite the fact that the challenges the telcos face and cost of production in Nigeria are clearly on a different scale.

Mob Sets Suspected Ritualist Ablaze In Delta
The man was caught with a human skull and other items in his possession.
There was pandemonium on Thursday at the Otokutu Bridge in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State following the arrest of a middle-aged man suspected to be a ritualist.
The man was caught with a human skull and other items in his possession.
The suspected ritualist, who was said to have been caught by the vigilante group in the area, was set ablaze by an angry mob few minutes after his arrest.
The incident, it was learnt, caused gridlock on the popular DSC Expressway as commuters and vehicle owners making use of that route spent several hours on top of the bridge.
Narrating the incident to our correspondent, a lady who witnessed the scenario, said the suspect had been acting like a deranged person around the bridge for the past months before he was discovered on Thursday when he tried to attack a motorcycle rider.
The woman said, "The ritualist who has been pretending to be a mad man for several months was about to attack and kill an Okada man who went close to the Otokutu Bridge when he was discovered.
“But as God will have it, the Okada rider escaped from the ritualist and he went to town and informed youths in the area.
On getting to the place, the mob saw the mad man making a call with a phone and upon sighting the people, he immediately threw the phone into a nearby river.     The youths and the vigilante conducted a search and a human skull suspected to be that of a lady and other handsets were found with him.
“Upon questioning him, he confessed to belonging to a notorious ritualist gang but declined to give more details and at this point, a mob poured him fuel and set him ablaze."
It was gathered that despite the presence of policemen at the scene, the mob succeeded in setting ablaze the suspected ritualist.”
Calls and messages to the spokesperson for the police in the state, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, were not responded to.
Monkey Chants, Racist Abuse Make Players Abandon English FA Match
The incident during the match in the fourth qualifying round came just five days after England players endured racist abuse during their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia.
An FA Cup qualifying match between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town was abandoned on Saturday after allegations that players were racially abused and spat on.
The players of seventh-tier outfit Haringey walked off the field with about 25 minutes to go, shortly after Yeovil had scored a penalty.
The incident during the match in the fourth qualifying round came just five days after England players endured racist abuse during their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia.
Haringey manager Tom Loizou said defender Coby Rowe suffered racial abuse while Cameroonian goalkeeper Douglas Pajetat was also spat at, prompting him to take his players off the pitch.
“Early into the second half, we got a corner and a couple of the players said to me there was monkey chants,” Loizou told Sky News.
“We got over that, we carried on playing. They got a penalty and my goalkeeper was spat at and had missiles thrown at him.
“The referee halted the game briefly, they scored the penalty, one of players went to pick the ball out of the back of the net and Coby Rowe was racially abused.”
Loizou said he had to take his players off.
“I looked at a couple of our players’ faces and I was distraught myself, just to see their faces. I gave it a couple of minutes and I went on the pitch and pulled my players off,” he said.
“There was no way that two or three of those players could have continued playing. What they heard was disgusting, they looked frightened.
“I can’t sit down and watch young players being abused by a minority.”
Rowe later posted on Twitter: “Can’t believe I’m tweeting this and it’s 2019 but today I was a victim of racism, in what was supposed to be a great day for @HaringeyBoroFC. Another game of football ruined by racists.”
Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out praised the “swift and decisive action” taken by Loizou and his players.
The FA said it was looking into the incident “as a matter of urgency”.
In a statement, Yeovil said: “We are aware that there are allegations that racist comments were made in the crowd and this allegation will be a key part of any investigation.
“Irrespective of the outcome of any investigations, we would like to make it clear that the club will not accept racism or discrimination in any form.”
England players endured monkey chants and apparent Nazi salutes in Bulgaria. That match was stopped twice as England players made their feelings known to UEFA officials before the tie was eventually completed.
Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings, who made his international debut that night and was singled out by the Bulgarian crowd, applauded Haringey for “taking a stance” against racism.
“Sometimes it can get brushed off in lower leagues but everyone stands with you,” he tweeted. “Our country isn’t perfect either.”

My Generation Too Weak, Cowardly To Fight For Nigeria, Says Don Jazzy     He said, “I believe my generation has been weak and almost equally at fault for the state Nigeria is in today.     Musician and producer, Don Jazzy, has blamed youths across Nigeria for failing to fight for a better country and accepting the status quo.

Mystery, Controversy Over ABU Student's Suicide By Ibrahim Adeyemi
She (Aisha's mother) has always loved her daughter and she feels she's old enough to know what she wants. Religion has nothing, I mean nothing, to do with this. Aishat's mother had nothing to do with Aishat converting from this to that. The mom has no problem with Aisha being a Muslim. Her mother has never interfered in it, her friend said.
Aisha Omolola
Dead or alive? Repressed and depressed by parents or not? These are the controversial queries that filled the social media airwaves after the mysterious suicide action taken by Aisha Omolola, a 300 level student of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in her apartment at Samaru, Kaduna State.
Omolola was said to have committed suicide by drinking insecticide. She also reportedly dropped a note, stating why she took her life. According to the note, she wrote that her family should be held responsible for her suicide, especially her mother and father. She said the duo made life miserable for her and thus, killing herself was the only way she could save herself from the family's frustration.
The letter reads below:
Just like I said, if I am no more, please hold my family especially my mum and dad responsible. I have tried to be the best I can be, stayed away from them just because they blame me for their mistakes and they can't love, help and take care of me like their own. My mum has made life a living hell for me only because she is bipolar and frustrated; accusing me of being a witch, trying to kill her and being a cursed child even though my brother is responsible for my education and upkeep. The only thing she helps me with is my feeding money. I have gone out of my way to take care of my mum by giving her food and money but I still end up being her problem. My brother can't stick to his promise anymore because he feels I am not his responsibility and I have my own family. I hope and believe that now that I am gone, it will bring them relief and happiness.
I am so sorry Collins, I had to leave you this way, Maryam Olayemi you have [been] more than a bestie to me. I am also sorry to all my friends and well wishers, I love to be happy but I'm nothing but a broken child. I don’t believe in God anymore, cos I can’t see my purpose anymore. I love you all so much.
When the news of the ABU student's suicide made headlines, most Nigerians condemned the act. However, there are still some questions surrounding her demise left unanswered.
Did Aisha Survive the Suicide Mission?
Few days after reactions followed Aisha's suicide action, it went viral on social media that she survived the attempt to commit suicide. The source of the rumour is traceable to the post on the Facebook page of Ahmadu Bello University, Samaru, Zaria. The post, which has more than a thousand shares and likes have made many Nigerians wonder whether she really survived her suicide mission.
However, the picture attached to the Facebook post, showing Aisha in the hospital receiving treatment is the first fact that falsifies the rumours. This is because the said picture was posted on Twitter sometime in October 2018, when Aisha was said to have had an accident.
The rumour was further falsified by eye-witnesses who witnessed how Aisha died and was buried. Audu Abdulqudus, a recent graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and close friend to Aisha affirmed that he was among many others who were present at her funeral on the same day she committed suicide.
I was the main friend that carried her dead body the very day she died at the Jamaa hospital in Samaru. I and her [best friend’s father], Mr AbdulGaniu with two policemen took her to the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital mortuary.     I was called by Maryam Salami, Aisha's childhood friend on Thursday evening towards 4:00pm. So, it was Maryam that now told me about the mum telling her that they were at the mortuary and they wanted to go and bury her that very evening on Thursday.
When contacted, Maryam Salami, a childhood friend of Aisha confirmed the death of her bosom friend, adding that Aisha’s death was mysterious. "We don't know what to say. That's how God planned her own death; let's just put it that way," she said.
Also, one Ruth Omole who was at Samaru hospital where Aisha gave up the ghost affirmed that Aisha did not survive the incident.
What to Note on the Suicide Note
The note left by Aisha about the cause of her suicide has created lots of controversies; there seems some mysterious issues thematically in the note. The impression generally created in the letter was that Aisha's parents frustrated and repressed her so much that they made her "not to believe in God anymore”, most especially her mother.
As indicated in the note, Aisha frowned at how her mother so much rejected and dejected her while she was alive. According to the note, she (her mother) would blame her for everything and even called her a witch.
Though all efforts to reach any of her parents proved abortive, the deceased’s childhood friend, Maryam Salami, first confirmed that Aisha was the original author of the letter. "Aisha wrote that letter. That's her handwriting," she affirmed. She, however, added that the interpretation of the note could best be conveyed by its author.
Half of what she said could be true and could not be true. It's a personal issue and we should leave it personal. In that letter, she said something that has to do with herself and her mother or people around her. We shouldn't interfere. That letter said a lot. I know what that letter means, but I don't want to say anything. That letter should just be left. That letter is nothing. People should just let bygone be bygone. We should just pray for her and God should forgive all of us, she said.
Were religious differences ever a barrier between Aisha and her parents? Salami said religion could not have been the apple of discord. This is contrary to what has been widely spread on social media. It was said that Aisha had been victimised by her parents just because she converted from being a Christian to a Muslim.
However, Salami, her friend said that could not be true, adding that Aisha was a person who was never religiously stable. She was a Christian today, Muslim tomorrow.
Aisha converting from a Christian to a Muslim is nothing. That has never or had never been the problem because right from primary school, Aisha has been one person that it's either she's a Muslim today or she's a Christian today, she said.
She (Aisha's mother) has always loved her daughter and she feels she's old enough to know what she wants. Religion has nothing, I mean nothing, to do with this. Aishat's mother had nothing to do with Aishat converting from this to that. The mom has no problem with Aisha being a Muslim. Her mother has never interfered in it, she added.
Really, the reason behind the deceased's suicide seems to be very mysterious. While the note portrays that she had no good relationship with her parents, especially her mother, her tweets proves contrary. On December 18, 2018, Aisha wrote on her Twitter page, praising and praying for her 'lovely mother’.
Ya Allah, bless my mom...keep her for me, give me the strength, ability and ways to be a blessing to her. Let me be the reason behind her smile and happiness. Please give her long life to reap the fruit of her labour. I love you mom. My Woman My Everything, she tweeted.
Also, on Tuesday December 25 of the same year, before Aisha committed suicide on Thursday, 27th of the same month and year, she posted on Twitter again, telling her friends how she would celebrate Christmas with her family even as a Muslim. "Ah celebrate Christmas too cos my family is mixed! Let love lead," she tweeted.
The question is: What could have happened between Aisha and her parents that could have warranted her to commit suicide within the aforementioned short period of time?
Before Suicide, Who was Aisha?
Minus the suicide reportedly committed by Aisha, her friends described her as being friendly, nice and generous.
As her childhood friend, Maryam also described Aisha as someone who was crazy but nice and friendly.
She's crazy. She has her ups and downs just like any other person. I've loved her for who she is. No matter how much she annoys me, I'll still go there and still look for her. She's always there to listen to people but she doesn't share any of her feelings or anything that is going on within her, she added.
Before her death, Aisha appeared to have enjoyed her stay on earth. On December 11, 2018, she tweeted: "God I thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for giving me reasons never to give up on life."
Also, on October 1, 2018, after she survived an accident, she posted on Twitter, giving thanks to God for her survival and praying for long life.
For a moment, I thought I was gonna die. In fact, I started saying my last prayers asking mom to pray for me too but ALHAMDULILLAH. I am a witness of Allah's mercy and by HIS Grace I shall live to see more healthy years,” she posted.     Nagode Aisha Buhari For Punching Garba Shehu, Mamman Daura’s Shoe Shiner By Churchill Okonkwo     Unfortunately for President Buhari and the people around him who claim to be speaking on his behalf even without his knowledge, Aisha has stayed in politics and has fired again. This time, she has accused her husband’s nephew, Mamman Daura, of giving out orders for the scrapping of the office of the First Lady. In the allegation, Aisha accused her husband’s spokesperson, Garba Shehu, of ordering for the scraping the office of the First Lady without the President’s knowledge. By this statement, Aisha Buhari is clearly saying that Garba Shehu is shining Mamman Daura’s shoes.     Aisha Buhari has proven herself before now as an amazon and woman of courage and character. When in October 2016 President Buhari said Aisha belongs to my kitchen, and my living room and the other room", a good percentage of Nigerians (men and women) lambasted him for demeaning and derogating women. In response, President Buhari stubbornly maintained that his wife belongs in the kitchen even in the face of national outcry. He added that Aisha should stay out of politics.

In the allegation, Aisha accused her husband’s spokesperson, Garba Shehu, of ordering for the scraping the office of the First Lady without the President’s knowledge. By this statement, Aisha Buhari is clearly saying that Garba Shehu is shining Mamman Daura’s shoes.
By speaking up on the cabal that hijacked her husband’s administration, again, Aisha Buhari is demonstrating an act of rare courage that encapsulates the theme of the 2017 International Women’s day “Women in the Changing World of Work. Aisha Buhari remains a model for Nigerian girls and women. For daring to voice the genuine concern of most Nigerians, Aisha Buhari should be seen and celebrated by Nigerian women (as well as men) as a symbol of courage.
In this latest sucker punch, Aisha Buhari stated that even with the scaping of the office of the First Lady by Shehu Garba and the real powers behind Buhari, she has raised funds to run her humanitarian programs. Aisha Buhari is building momentum for the effective implementation of the goal to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls; ensuring inclusive and quality education for all, promoting lifelong learning and celebrating extraordinary women.
I am particularly thrilled by the power and stubborn determination exhibited by Aisha when on his return in October, he publicised and cleared the air on the many rumors that took over social media on some incidents in Aso Rock. Aisha Buhari, thus, did the job that Shehu Garba is paid to do.
Shehu Garba and Femi Adesina, who ordinarily should know better, have been celebrating imprisonment of press freedom in Nigeria. The media team of the Nigerian Presidency is grossly incompetent and has been displaying a blurred vision. Vision blurred by intellectual dullness and moral depravity.
This was clearly on display from the allegations Aisha Buhari leveled against Garba Shehu whom she accused of attempting to sack her media crew and getting them suspended for doing their job. Shehu Garba and Femi Adesina who recently claimed that millions of Nigerians do not care about Omoyele Sowore’s illegal detention have brought more shame and disgrace to the President and the office of the President they are paid to manage. Shameful.
As Aisha Buhari, rightly pointed out, “in saner climes, Garba Shehu would have resigned immediately after going beyond his boundaries and powers.” But no, Shehu Garba will not resign.
The culture of affirmation as opposed to challenge being displayed by the likes of Shehu Garba and Femi Adesina is disturbing and by some measures, offensive. Be it laziness or narcissism, there is little excuse for obviously well paid and well-educated professionals to relax into tired inertia. They deceive themselves and those around them that Nigeria is being moved in the right direction by this administration. Thus, the future of Nigeria is being threatened by sloppy thinking as superstitious nonsense spread its tentacles.
Aisha’s sucker punch of Shehu Garba as a person with not just intellectual dullness but one that also has intellectual dishonesty should be worrying to all supporters of President Buhari, myself inclusive.
To paraphrase Cyril Connolly, Garba Shehu with all his talents has now condemned himself to second-rate thought and the degrading job of shinning Mamman Daura’s Shoes. He has shown himself to be intellectually lazy and shallow: peddling ignorance as an actual governing alternative. It is very interesting watching Garba Shehu descend to the lowest level of a sycophant shining Daura’s shoes in other to keep his job.
Two months ago when the Economic Advisory Committee was empaneled and some agencies under the vice president were displaced, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, dismissed insinuations of a quarrel between the president and his deputy.
Appearing on national television, Adesina stated: “You seem to forget that the vice president is the number two man in the country. If the president is away, the vice president acts because it is a joint ticket. Therefore, the new economic advisory body can also relate with the vice president when necessary.
“It is just some Nigerians, who want to drive a wedge between the president and the vice president that are reading meaning to everything. They insinuate about everything. It is still one presidency and decisions taken are best for the country.”
But, in an apparent show of different approaches and understanding of issues, Prof. Osinbajo denounced the invasion of the court by the DSS. The vice president made his feelings known while rejecting an award from the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism as Anti-corruption Defender.
Osinbajo was announced as the recipient of the Integrity Specialty of the Anti-Corruption Defender Award for his “invaluable work of overhauling the Lagos State Judiciary, facilitating far-reaching reforms in the administration of justice in the state, his work of promoting integrity in the civil society and business in Nigeria and his consistency as a strong voice for promoting integrity in the country.”
But in a letter by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Laolu Akande, Osinbajo stated: “However, two reasons explain my absence. First is that I am currently in Abu Dhabi for an international meeting under the auspices of the government of the UAE where I am the keynote speaker.
“Second, in view of the developments on Friday in the Sowore case, I think it would be insensitive and inappropriate to attend the ceremony.”
The disparity in their vocations seems to explain the divergent attitude to the rule of law by the president and his deputy. While President Buhari, a former head of state, comes from the military background, Prof. Osinbajo is a professor of law and Senior Advocate of Nigeria.
President Buhari allowed security chiefs extended stay in office after their terms elapsed. At a Nigeria Bar Association conference last year, the president caused a national stir when he stated that the rule of law is subordinate to the national interest. Does that mindset excuse the disdain shown by Nigeria’s secret police to the court in their overzealous attempt to take the law into their hands?
Most Nigerians believe that Mr. Osinbajo’s professional competence and know-how do not come into the reckoning in the performance of the duties of the office of the president, thereby putting a lie to the one presidency claim!
By Njideka Agbo
The third sentence in her Twitter bio is direct and unambiguous – You would either love me or hate me and either one is perfectly okay!
Often maligned for her stance on national issues in Nigeria by pro-government voices, she is not a run-off-the-mill activist. Her penchant for naming names has earned her truckloads of enemies, and perhaps, admirers.
Born in Northern Nigeria, a society where speaking up as a female was unheard of, 10-year-old Yesufu was already standing up against injustice.
“Even though my parents or adults were angry at me for speaking up especially when it does not favour them; when they had that need to have someone that was unbiased to look at issues, they would call me.”
“I have the gift to look at issues from both sides even when I am involved and when I am not. I am able to tell people, “okay look at it like this”. My mother would always say, ‘nobody wins in your court’, but in that same court when they want the issues to be told plainly, they would come.”
Perhaps, her ability to speak up might be linked to her status as the firstborn in her family and the fact that she saw her father lose everything that he has.
Aisha Yesufu
That experience would change her life and thinking pattern forever. Rather than dwell on the losses and what could have been, the young Yesufu learned that life could change in an instant and because of that, she needed to make an impact urgently.
“There was a time in my life in secondary school that I would go to school without breakfast and come back, not expecting lunch.”
Another attribute she says helped her during this period was her insatiable hunger for books. Reading made her realise “there was a world beyond the ghetto that I was growing up in…and I wanted that life… and thank God in 2014, my mum would call and say, thank you for dreaming for everybody.”
Yet, as it is customary in a patriarchal society such as Nigeria, the issue of being a girl sprung up occasionally.
“You were seen as vulnerable because you were a girl. During our time, you were not even supposed to have a voice and even though it got me into a lot of trouble then, I was good with that [speaking up].”
As Aisha grew, her knowledge and refusal to back down grew even if it meant an argument with her father. “Sometimes, I would argue with my father for literally 12 hours and my mother would use her eyes to tell me to stop.”
Like Aisha, her father was a tough breed in school and would challenge authorities which would sometimes land him in trouble. “My mum would say, you are complaining and she is just like you,” she says chuckling.
Yesufu’s stubborn trait sprung up again in 1991 when she wanted to enrol in the NDA (Nigerian Defence Academy) and was rejected because she was a woman. “The most painful part is that I was told that women don’t attend. I was angry and was ranting.”
At the three universities (Uthman Dan Fodio, Ahmadu Bello and Bayero) she attended, she recalls that her friends would avoid moving with her at the administrative block for fear of getting rusticated. “I knew those times that they could drive me away from school but I always thought, ‘on the issue, I am going to follow it through’. ”
Yesufu quickly learned that if she was going to continue speaking up, she had to ensure that her integrity was maintained. In 2000, during the compulsory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), she would fight to a standstill to return the extra stipend that was paid into her account. “The NYSC officials were asking, ‘what type of thing is this?’ and frustrated me in every way.” “Today I ask myself if I had kept that money, what moral justification would I have to speak against injustice?”
Like the stars aligning in her favour, that prepared her for what she has become known for- activism.
While Yesufu’s family had adjusted to her stubborn traits, her mother was concerned about the marital future of her daughter and if she would be able to stay married.
Coupled with the fact that she had no female friends when she was 11 because they were all married off or dead [during childbirth] and her getting married at 24, a time considered as late by some conservatives in Northern Nigeria.
Yet, Yesufu says that her husband of 21 years is her number one fan.
With his support, she can face the world, she adds with a hint of pride. His main priority, she says, is to ensure that she is happy doing what she loves to do.
Beyond this, Yesufu admits that she is “lazy” when it comes to house chores, a trait, that did not sit well with her parents when she was growing up.
“I am very, very lazy. My parents used to say, ‘Is everything book?’ Even when my husband proposed, I told him, I am lazy and I hate housework, I hate cooking and he was ready to go with it.”
“I set systems in place to work for me. I hire and pay people to make me jobless. By the grace of God, I will never work for anybody so I have time on my hands.”
That is not even the rather surprisingly part. She says that she was the one who approached her husband. “I first laid eyes on my husband on the 13th of December 1996 and I fell over heels in love with him and went after him.” 16 months later, they tied the knots.
She tells me that at the early stages of their relationship, her husband spoke to her on the need to stay financially independent. “He was an auditor and was always travelling. One day he told me, ‘If anything ever happens to me, I will want you to always take care of yourself and kids if we have them’.”
“Being brought up to expect that a man that will take of you, it was my husband that taught me to be financially independent so that I can have control over my voice and not be dependent.”
Aisha Yesufu
Interestingly, Yesufu says that if she did not take up activism, she would have been a singer and dancer. Doing what she loves to do includes living life to the fullest, travelling and acting goofy, she tells me laughing. She also prides herself as “very romantic.” “I have been married for 21 years and every day is a romantic fantasy that I am fulfilling.”
Good thing her last child is going to the university so there is more time to have fun with her husband, she says.
It is clear that her activism has made a huge impression on Nigerians. Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG), the longest-standing protest in Nigeria, attracted the attention of former first lady of the United States, Michell Obama; Hillary Clinton; had its hashtag #BringBackOurGirls tweeted more than 2 million times; inspired a spark of protests in US, UK, South Africa, Jamaica and Switzerland; represented in Marvel’s Black Panther; spoken on by Wyclef John, Chris Brown, and disseminated by the international and national press.
Since the BBOG, Nigerians have exhibited boldness to speak up against the government, go on protests and have been vocal about their grievances.
This does not mean that she is not oblivious of the fear expressed by people in society.
“Of course, there is always that fear that if you speak out, you will be killed… but death is death and it would come when it would come.”
“The worst thing anyone can do to me is to kill me. I’m going to die anyway, so it’s really not the worst thing because It is going to happen anyway. It’s another kind of death too if I am not able to express myself.”
In respect to this, she says that every time she goes to protest; she says her last prayers. “I say maybe I am not going to leave this place, but whatever it is, that is what it will be.”
As the number of Nigerians voicing out against government stays on the rise, Yesufu is happy with the change of status quo.
“Growing up, the average Nigerian was taught that you should not question elders. They grew up with how not to question authority and it went on through school. Now that they have become adults, they have used government to replace parents so they don’t question authority.”
“Fortunately, we are seeing more movements like BBOG inspire them to stay on course. They are realising that the office of the citizen is actually the highest office in the land. They are realizing that we don’t need permission from the police to protest but protection.”
“Whatever I am doing today, I am fighting for that little girl that I was that yearned for help, that begged to be helped with a textbook so that I can read and pass my exams. If I ever give up that fight, I will be giving up on myself.”
Giving credence to social media and Oby Ezekwesili, a one-time Guardian Life cover subject, she says that Ezekwesili contributed massively to Nigerians embracing this truth.
In recognition of the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief, she says strongly that the case of Leah Sharibu is an atrocity against humanity. She opines that a girl-child in an education quest should not have her future truncated because of religion.
“I always tell people that the case of the Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is a world case because when you say to the girl-child that she should dare to dream and shatter glass ceilings and she looks at the fact that 279 of the sisters did that and were abducted, and 112 girls are still in captivity and she sees that the abduction was because they dared to dream and refused to renounce her (Sharibu) religion, then the world needs to consider what actions the girl-child will be looking at.”
Then again, in a country where religion is seen as a primary factor in one’s life, she says matter-of-factly that a major problem with Nigerians is their unacceptance of religion as a personal journey. “As a people, we are very religious but we are godless. We are more interested in eye-service. The same person who goes to church or mosque every day will not find it wrong in committing fraud or engaging in corruption.”
Faulting the pilgrimage and the forex trading that Nigerian governments engage in, she opines that undue relevance is given to things that should remain personal.
“The Nigerian system is wired in such a way that religion is given so much relevance when it comes to state matters. Why? They are subsidising for pilgrimage but not education which is more important. Of course, the politicians have found a way to use religion to gain things out of sentiment.”
“Don’t tell me what religion you are, show me. Let me see empathy in you. Most people are ready to fight for religion but are not ready to fight for humanity.. when we get to heaven, everyone will see who went where,” she adds.
Aisha Yesufu
In life’s stories such as this, it is commonplace to hear tales of struggles, yet Yesufu who describes herself as a survivor calmly tells me that throwing in the towel is not something she can identify with. Linking it back to her stubbornness, she says that every attempt to take up an issue translates to her knowing the end thereof even if it means losing an opportunity.
“Is the opportunity worth it? Maybe it is because I have no attachment to anything, even life itself.”
“What I am never ready to lose is my worth, dignity, integrity, and character. If I lose everything and have to sell pure water, I will carry it on my head with dignity, and character intact.”
“Another thing is, I hold myself to high standards.” “No politician or anyone in any parastatal would tell you that Aisha Yesufu came to my office to seek for an appointment or a contract.”
“I want a level playing ground for everybody where the woman who sells groundnuts or is frying akara or the motorcyclists that are working hard to send their children to school should be able to get jobs based on their capacity and ability and not on who they know.”
If she is bothered about the impression of people about her since then, she says she is not one to consider that as important and is unapologetic about her stance.
“When people say ‘don’t you know you are a woman?’, I tell them, I don’t know.”
“If you check my twitter, you’d see I don’t really do labels. I don’t see myself as male or female, activist or anything, I am me.”
AmbodeThe Igbo people in Lagos have described Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode as a detribalised Nigerian committed to the development of the state.
The spokesman of the group, Dr. Innocent N. Nwankwo, revealed this when he led members of Igbo community for the endorsement of Ambode’s second term and inauguration of the Women Forum of Itesiwaju Ipinle Eko Vanguard in the Badagry division.
He said his people supported the move to endorse the governor because of his performance, noting that the governor has proved himself to be a detribalised Nigerian and a highly focused leader who is committed to the growth of the society.
Speaking at the event, the Coordinator General of Itesiwaju Ipinle Eko Vanguard, Mr. Seyi Bamigbade, said the all-inclusive governance introduced by the present administration had scaled up rapid infrastructural development in the state.

The Nigerian economy has a bad attitude. I am sure you know that by now. This attitude borders on pure hostility and an unholy determination to defeat every effort by our leaders to tame it and free the nation and its people from the ever present danger of our descent into poverty.
I trace the beginning of the bad attitude of the economy between 1981 and 1982 when the crude oil buyers in the international market refused to buy our crude oil in quantities large enough to keep the petro-dollar flowing into our national treasury. This resulted into something called glut – a technical name for too much oil looking for scarce buyers. We had on our hands the blight dreaded by the managers of every nation’s economy called recession. Wealth receding like the hair on your pate? Got it.
Nigeria was instantly faced with serious new challenges in the management of its economy. It was forced to accept that the crude oil market is volatile. It is unreliable at the best of times. Its vagaries could, and without warning, suddenly turn the flow of petro-dollar into a trickle. For the first time since crude oil put our country on the world map of rich nations, we faced the challenge of managing poverty – not one of the easiest challenges in life.
But President Shehu Shagari, bless him, rose to the challenge. He imposed austerity measures on the country to force federal and state governments as well as individuals to spend less and live less conspicuously, as in substituting kaftan for richly embroidered baban riga and palm wine and ogogoro and burukutu for Crystal champagne. Rice, milk and semovita became essential commodities for which we queued up for hours daily to get our family rations. It was not the best of times – recession times, that is.
It would seem that that the president could not quite force the economy to change its bad attitude. The austerity measures did not, for instance stop the national chairman of the ruling party, Chief Adisa Akinloye, from importing personalized champagne. The situation attracted the military politicians and they abandoned their barracks for state and government houses. The coup announcer, Major-General Sani Abacha (as he was then) said they were forced to return because the economy “had been hopelessly mismanaged.” Because of the continuing bad attitude of the economy, our democracy found itself impaled on the spike.
And then, there began a series of military approaches to make the economy behave. Major-General Muhammadu Buhari, the new head of state, decided that the first step was to restore the confidence of our international business partners in us a credit worthy nation. He committed 45 per cent of his budget to servicing the debts accumulated during the brief life span of the second republic. He also exchanged the crude oil few wanted for the goods we needed to import. But I do not think the economy was impressed sufficiently to make the steps he took the right steps needed to wean it from its bad attitude.
Then the batons changed hands within the military. Major-General (as he was then) Ibrahim Babangida climbed the saddle. He introduced the most radical approach to the management of the national economy. He believed the way to go was to attack the economy by structurally adjusting its base, not in line with the infamous IMF and the World Bank prescriptions for ailing national economies but as home-grown alternatives to them – prescriptions designed by Nigerians and owned by Nigerians.
The structural adjustment programme, with the unfortunate acronym of SAP, meant that we now had to contend with the pains associated with restructuring the economy. We did not prepare for this painful turn of events. We rioted. The SAP riots of 1989 told Babangida in no uncertain terms that the bad attitude of the economy had more or less defeated his home-grown prescriptions.
The bad habit of the economy remains with us today. It has turned us into a nation with the cruel paradox of rich but poor nation. Buhari returned to power as a civilian president in 2015, promising to fix the economy and end that paradox. But a year later, in 2016, the economy with a bad habit showed its hands again. A second recession hit us, I think between the eyes.
The bad habit of the national economy has hit our nation with a litany of woes. Chew on a few of them here, if you would. Because of the bad habit of the economy, 98.8 million Nigerians live, not just in poverty but in extreme poverty. It feels like standing on the precipice. Because of the bad habit of the economy, our country became the poverty capital of the world in 2018. India wore that crown for many years. Nigeria dethroned India – an achievement no Nigerian is proud of. India has 1.3 billion people; Nigeria has 200 million people. It is not natural for the less populated nation to be poorer than the more populated nation.
Still, the news on the economic front continues to spell the word b-a-d for our country. In its 2019 Nigeria Economic Update released last week, the World Bank predicted that if the economy continues with its current bad habit, Nigeria would continue to get poorer and extremely poorer and that by the year 2030, 30 million more Nigerians would cross the line from poor to extremely poor. And Nigeria will be home to 25% of the world’s extremely poor.
To put a fine point on it, the World Poverty Clock reports that Nigeria sinks into greater poverty every six minutes. That steady slide towards the precipice took the number of the extremely poor in the country from 87 million to some 98.8 million early this month. Remember that we are between 198 and 200 million people. The extremely poor figure means that nearly half of us are living on less than $1.90 a day. The bad habit of the economy is a deep-rooted problem. It has shamed our rulers one after the other. It refuses to relent. It boggles the mind.
Buhari has promised to lift 100 million out of poverty in the next 10 years. It works out at 10 million people a year. The applause that attends that promise must be moderated by the fact that the president does not have ten years in Aso Rock, although it is not impossible that whatever policy he might initiate could outlive his tenure and ten years later, he could claim the credit for it. If his promise holds, we should expect 30 million fewer people living below the poverty line by the time he leaves office in 2023.
So far, Buhari has not released the blueprint for his welcome ambition. I hope there is one. He goes a-borrowing now because to cure the economy of its bad habit, there must be money to spend by the government. Borrowing takes the borrower down the path of grief. Makes you feel that his promise is targeted at a political sound bite.
There is no room for a cosmetic approach to the problem. According to the World Bank, “economic and demographic projections highlight the urgent need for reform. With population growth (estimated at 2.6 per cent) outpacing economic growth in a context of weak job creation, per capita income is falling.”
The World Bank also reports that “Close to 80 per cent of poor households are in northern Nigeria.” This is not exactly new but it shows how truly slowly we have moved all these years to make a difference in how the economy benefits all Nigerians. With this growing disparity between the north and the south, we shall eventually create two Nigerias – one, relatively well off and living above the poverty line and the other sinking deeper into the morass of extreme poverty.
The bank warns that “inaction” or “a business-as-usual scenario” is not an option open to the Nigerian government. Nigeria, it says, “has the opportunity to advance reforms to mitigate” the consequences of the steady slide down the poverty chute. Buhari needs no one to tell him to grab that opportunity to halt the slide and moderate the bad habit of the economy.

Britain’s Anthony Joshua reclaimed his world heavyweight crown from Andy Ruiz on Saturday, outclassing the Mexican-American to score a unanimous points victory.
Joshua, who suffered a stunning knockout defeat to Ruiz in New York in June, produced a masterclass to regain his IBF, WBA and WBO titles in emphatic fashion.
Dominating from the outset, Joshua won by margins of 118-110 on two scorecards with the third judge making it 119-109.
Billed as the “Clash on the Dunes”, the eagerly anticipated rematch marked the first time a world heavyweight title fight has been staged in Saudi Arabia.
And after entering the purpose-built open-air arena at Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi capital, just after midnight, it was Joshua who rose to the occasion with a stylish victory.
The final scores in no way flattered Joshua, who frustrated his heavier opponent with superb movement while picking off Ruiz relentlessly with his jab.
Joshua, badly stung by his defeat to Ruiz at Madison Square Garden, was ecstatic after clinching a one-sided win.
“The first time was so nice, I had to do it twice,” Joshua said as he celebrated becoming a two-time world heavyweight champion.
The 2012 Olympic champion revealed he had adapted his style after June’s loss to Ruiz, when he got drawn into a slugfest before being floored four times on his way to the first loss of his career.
“I’m used to knocking guys out and last time, I realised that I hurt the man but I got caught coming in,” said Joshua, who improved to 23-1, 21 by knockout.
“No excuses, but I said to myself I’m going to correct it and come again.”
“I just wanted to put on a great boxing masterclass tonight and also show the sweet science of this lovely sport,” Joshua added. “t’s about hitting and not getting hit.”
Ruiz had shocked onlookers at Friday’s weigh-in by tipping the scales at 283 pounds (128.4 kilograms), fully 15 pounds heavier than his weight in the first fight.
Joshua by contrast came in at 237 pounds, his leaner, less bulky physique allowing him to dance around the ring for 12 rounds to leave Ruiz pawing at shadows.
Ruiz admitted he had prepared poorly for the rematch.
“It was his night man,” Ruiz said. “I didn’t prepare as I should of. I gained too much weight. But I don’t want to make excuses, he won, he bossed me around.
“But if we do a third fight you best believe I’m going to get in the best shape of my life.”
Pressed on his excess weight, Ruiz said it had “affected me a lot.”
“I thought I was going to feel stronger and feel better, but on my next fight I’m going to get better prepared.”
The Nigerian Army has refuted the ‘mass killing of Igbo youths’ allegation by the Campaign for Democracy (CD), an online publication, recently.
Col. Sagir Musa, the Deputy Director Army Public Relations of the 82 Division of the Nigerian Army, Enugu, in a statement in Awka on Sunday, described it as “an “unjustified, invidious and over flogged accusation’’.
He said the CD claimed that “no fewer than 2000 Igbo youths had been killed by the Nigerian Army under the guise of Rules of Engagement’’.
He said that other publication allegations including “Military Killed 150 Pro-Biafra Protesters’’ had also been severally thoroughly refuted in many media platforms by the Nigerian Army.
“It is the same position that this rejoinder has soundly adopted.
“For emphasis and clarity, the Nigerian Army as an accountable, morally and professionally sound organisation had variously through its Human Rights Desk at the Army Headquarters, painstakingly investigated allegations of rights violations.
“The results indicated specifically that this claim is false, malicious and should, therefore, be ignored for the sake of Nigeria.
“Instructively, the Nigerian Army under its constitutional authorization to aid Civil Authority and Military Aid to Civil Power must continue to act in the best interest of the nation (in collaboration with other security agencies).
“This included, de-escalating violence and checkmating security threats across the nation.
“This task must be done, in spite of the sordid propaganda and possible politicisation of the issue by ill-meaning Nigerians,’’ Musa said.
According to him, the relevant authorities in the South East are at liberty to set up an inquiry into the accusation to get to the roots and end of the obnoxious and unfounded claim.
“Looking at the recurrent posture of this allegation, the 82 Division Nigerian Army wishes to state that relevant authorities in the South East are at liberty to set up an inquiry into this accusation.
“This is with the view to getting to the roots and end of this obnoxious and unfounded claim,’’ he said.
Some assailants on Sunday night attacked and injured the Managing Director of Maersk Shipping Line Nigeria, Gildas Tohouo, in his Lagos, Ikoyi home, and also stabbed his Hungarian wife to death at the family’s residence in highbrow Ikoyi area of the state.
Tuhouo who was said to be critically injured, is receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Victoria Island. The deceased, a Hungarian named Bernadett Kurucz, had a career with APM Shipping, and Lite-On, according to information she published on her Facebook page.
Maersk is an integrated container logistics company that prides itself as “connecting and simplifying trade to help our customers grow and thrive”. The company has a team of over 76,000 operating in 130 countries.
Although the couple were at their Lugard home with their three kids, the assailants did not harm the children. As at press time, two of his domestic staff, alleged to have connived with the intruders, have been arrested.
According to the police, the suspects, Olamide Goke and Ade Akanbi, were found with the knife suspected to have been used during the operation.
Reacting to the incident, the company in a press statement signed by one Richard Smith, confirmed the incident. Quoting David Williams, Regional Managing Director of Africa for A.P. Moller – Maersk, Smith said: “We are very sorry to confirm that a colleague and his family have been attacked in their residence in Lagos, Nigeria.
“Tragically, the wife of our colleague passed away at the scene. Our colleague is in the hospital, where his condition is critical, but stable. The three children are all safe and accounted for. Our thoughts and deepest sympathy goes to the family. We will do whatever we can to support them in this tragedy.
“The relatives of the family are in the process of being notified. Relevant authorities are investigating the incident. Maersk is supporting the investigation in every possible way,” he said.
Tohouo, a Cameroonian, is in charge of the Danish company’s operation in Nigeria. It was gathered that Tohouo and his wife were locked up during the attack on Sunday night. The wife, who was reportedly asked to transfer money to the assailants, was later threatened to drink a toxic substance.
While the attack was ongoing, Tohouo reportedly placed a call to the chief security officer of his company, who led policemen to the scene of the crime. The attackers were said to have gained entrance into the building through an electrician, who has since been arrested.
The Lagos police spokesperson, Bala Elkana, did not respond to enquires on the development yesterday except to confirmed the incident, saying Tohouo and his wife were stabbed.
“The wife died and he is still alive and responding to treatment. Those who carried it out are in our custody. One of them is an electrician in the estate, who was assisted by his friend. Their aim was to steal from the man. They were there to rob,” the police spokesperson said.
Tohouo, who has been a long term employee of Maersk, serving in Guangzhou, China, Cameroon, was appointed into the position as managing director in Nigeria in 2016. He also oversees Maersk’s operation in Benin, Niger, Togo and Ghana.
He is a multi-linguist, speaking English, French and German. After a Masters degree in Economics and applied management, he also attended the Maersk International Shipping Education.
John Ugbe
The Chief Executive Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, Mr. John Ugbe, has called for better balance and increased diversity of perspectives in the country’s Brands and Marketing Communications industry.
Ugbe made the call yesterday in a keynote address delivered at the third annual Women in Marketing and Communications Conference and Awards (WIMCA), organised by Brand Communicator Magazine. The conference, which held at the MUSON Centre in Lagos, is a foremost industry thought leadership platform. This year’s edition was conceived to address issues of equity, equality and balance in the Brands/Marketing Communications sector. In his address, Ugbe noted that balance transcends gender and is actually about diversity in thought, skills, age, gender, socio-economic and demographic strata, ethno-religious lines as well as across experience.
Balance, Ugbe contended, is about “more representation and the ability to represent our target communities and audience.” He stated that the survival and relevance of the Brands/Marketing Communications industry rests on ensuring it has more diverse perspectives
“We need to talk about how we can be a more representative industry; that is, representative of the population we represent, our customers, clients, communities, organizations and societies.
“When we speak about balance, it is beyond gender balance, so not only ensuring that we have more women in our industry, although this is important, very important in fact.
Ugbe explained that having a board on which both genders are equally represented does not exactly indicate balance, given that its members could be from the same state, ethnic or religious group.
“How representative is this for an industry that seeks to be truly innovative? How are we ensuring better diversity across socio-economic demographic, experience, age, ability and disability, skills disability? We need to expand our understanding of balance, and start to see how we can be truly representative,” he added.
He admitted that the starting point for balance should be gender, noting that there have been many extreme cases of bias against women. “Gender balance is really important across every level in our organizations. One way to achieve this is to recognise and celebrate the achievements of women in our organizations and in our industry. As I mentioned in my introduction, today we launch the Multihoice Women’s Forum. It’s our way of celebrating the achievements of women across MultiChoice and keeping them in the forefront always,” he stated.

Speaking at the presentation, BA Regional Commercial Manager for West Africa, Kola Olayinka, remarked that the initiative is in line with the company’s vision to empower the younger generation. “Being in operations globally for a century and in Nigeria for 83 years, British Airways is committed to making an impact in communities where it operates. We see this as an opportunity to empower the girl child and encourage them to follow their passion. We are committed to helping the next generation of Nigerians with access to resources to help them be the best that they can be and be able to give back to their society in future.”
He applauded Pearl Foundation for the initiative and what it has been able to achieve thus far. He went on to encourage the students studying at the centre to remain steadfast in what they do and be open to learning more to achieve a bright future for themselves.
The GirlsCoding is an intense program organised for young girls aged between 10 to 17 years, living in underserved communities in Nigeria. The program aims to train them in computer, robotics and web development skills, with a learning process in basic programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.
The Foundation promotes the cause and advancement of vulnerable girls and women through different projects and mentoring opportunities for the purpose of economic independence.While commending BA for the donation, the founder of Pearl Foundation and CNN Hero 2018, Abisoye Ajayi-Akinfolarin, stated, “we want them to have a different life regardless of their background and be able to achieve economic independence.”
“We believe it’s important for young girls to know how to be creators of technology and not just mere users and consumers. Over 400 girls have been successfully trained to gain economic independence through technology and become problem solvers in their different communities,” she added.
Some of the projects solely built by these girls include Makoko Fresh, an ecommerce platform that connects buyers of seafood to the fishermen who live in Makoko; Break the Blade, an advocacy tool which aims to sensitise people on the negativity of the Female Genital Mutilation and Hope Basket, a project built to serve as a middlemen collecting from the more fortunate and giving to the less privileged.
GirlsCoding continues to expand and has brought its initiatives to various communities, some of which include; GirlsCoding Makoko, GirlsCoding IDP Camp and GirlsCoding Jos.BA is currently celebrating its centenary year and is dedicated to the growth and development of the future generation.

Beating Breast Cancer
Mrs Kehinde Gbelee, Mrs Ebunola Anozie and Ms Della Ogunleye are the three most unlikely women to sit in the same room. Mrs Kehinde is a bespectacled academic, cool, collected and cerebral she self corrects like an iPhone as she speaks, her length sentences peppered with “rather than”s and “perhaps.” Mrs Anozie is classically beautiful and eerily quiet, her eyes sweeping along the room like an analyst saving everything and saying nothing, her hard-won smiles unfurling slowly like night-blooming jasmine. Ms Della Ogunleye is a garrulous sun, energetic, self-sustaining and pulling everyone towards her with her effusive warmth, speaking in sentences too quickly even for native English speakers to keep up with, her smile permanent and her hands always reaching out to give a reassuring touch. With such opposing personalities, no one would guess these women have more in common than most people.
Each of them has been touched by cancer.
In 1985, Breast Cancer Awareness Month was founded as a partnership between the American Cancer Society and the pharmaceutical division of Imperial Chemical Industries. Almost 34 years later, it has become a cultural phenomenon. The pink ribbon which has now become synonymous with cancer survivor and charity marathons is also everywhere but long before it was so much as an epiphany, Mrs Anozie was founding C.O.P.E (Care Organization and Public Enlightenment).
“When we first started in 1995, we were chastised. We were told we were jobless, we did not know what we were doing because it was a new thing in Nigeria at the time. Now we have centres everywhere.”
Mrs Ebunola Anozie, Founder COPE
C.O.P.E- Mrs Anozie’s brainchild organisation to help raise cancer awareness and create a space for cancer survivors to share their experience, now has over 40 surviving members but has touched millions of lives. Providing everything from screenings to advocacy to clinical breast examinations to spa days, Mrs Anozie is determined to be an advocate for cancer survivors despite not being a cancer survivor herself but having faced it up close and personal.
“In 1970, Lagos State sponsored my mother to go for treatment for colorectal cancer outside the country in Oxford, England. Unfortunately, a few weeks later a telegram came announcing her death and her body was flown back. My siblings and I were quite young and it was very traumatic for the entire family.”
But her mother wouldn’t be the only parent she lost to cancer. In 1995, she would lose her father to stomach cancer, the result of a Russian carcinogenic tea called Caga Soft Tea. The Minister of Health Professor Ikoye Ransom Kuti would issue a public warning but by then it was already too late for her Anozie’s father.
“When he passed it was quite traumatic and I must say it humbled me. It was a loss I don’t think I can ever forget.”
That same year, in October, Mrs Anozie on a trip to the UK felt a twinge of pain in her left breast.
“I went to have a mammogram immediately but was told I was too young. Luckily, I eventually found a doctor who told me it was just stress.”
But the spark was lit and she spent the rest of her holiday calling cancer centres and organisations to find out more. By the time her holiday was over, she came back with a suitcase full of cancer books and a resolve to start a cancer organization. She quit her finance job and fast forward 24 years later, she’s the founder of one of Nigeria’s best cancer support and awareness organisations helping some of the 41,913 Nigerian women who develop cancer every year.
Ms Della Ogunleye
But these dreary statistics, Ms Della Ogunleye argues, while they should be public knowledge shouldn’t be all everyone thinks about when they talk about cancer and the conversation around it should be more positive.
“Sometimes I say cancer is the best thing that ever happened to me because it gave me the opportunity to take care of myself.”
After being diagnosed and undergoing a mastectomy, Ms Ogunleye upped her gym regimen and found happiness. Now, she’s an exercise advocate.
“Most of the time I post everything when I’m in the gym, it’s not just to say ah look at me, it’s to help and inspire others.” But she doesn’t just advocate for exercise, Ogunleye is currently advocating for more black voices in the cancer sphere.
“I used to go for group therapy meetings and I was the only black person there. Black people are less likely to attend breast screenings because we always think it’s nothing to do with us and by the time they catch it, it’s too late. You have people being diagnosed and they’re not telling anybody. A few years ago, a friend whispered to me that she had something to tell me, I thought she would say something like that ‘your boyfriend is gay.’ Instead she said, ‘I have breast cancer,’ I was like, ‘what’s the big deal?’ If you don’t tell anybody the doctors here don’t know how to treat anyone because they don’t see the symptoms and you’re shying away.”
She always wanted a black person to hold her hand and because she didn’t have one she became one.
“I don’t know much about prevention, if I did, I wouldn’t be here. No one told me any stories about anyone having cancer so I didn’t know. So I’ve decided to take on the role for myself. I told myself whatever it takes I will do. Till today I still get messages on my Instagram saying, ‘oh you’re on the front of another cancer web page.’ Because if you don’t see another black person you won’t be able to relate. It’s teaching people that they are not alone.”
Now a globally recognised cancer advocate, Ms Ogunleye sees her future as only going up.
“The first black person I met with breast cancer was Kehinde who said she had hers 20 years ago, mine is 9, if she’s survived then I will survive. Each year I am counting to 20 years so I can eventually celebrate!”

Blaqbonez Potrait
Blaqbonez may not be the most widely known Nigerian rapper, but at the moment there is hardly anyone generating enough buzz. That, in itself, is not even the story. It is the cockiness and self-assurance behind his belief that he is the best rapper not even in Nigeria but in Africa.
And yes, he believes he is better than even his mentor MI Abaga who handed him his biggest break to date. And again, he has no apologies for that.
Braggadocio is at the core of raps oft-talk about hyper-masculinity but Blaq drips it more than any rapper of his generation. His is steeped in the quality of lyrics instead of his masculinity and physical strength. Maybe his lanky frame will not allow that.
“I’m the best rapper in Africa”, he tells me even before we started the interview proper. “I’m better than everybody.”
“I’m sorry, other guys (including MI) are dope. But I’m the best. I listen to my music and compare to what other rappers are doing. People need to step up.”
His last mixtape, The Last Time Under, released before his debut album is reflective of that mindset. The now prophetic mixtape showed he was hungry for fame and success. But largely confined him to the realm of underground rap.
In spite of that overarching fine blend of battle-ready spirit and cockiness, Blaqbonez is very much aware of his commercial viability and reach.
When his debut LP dropped in 2018 as the final instalment of 100 crowns (an imprint of Chocolate City Records) LAMBAugust rollout, that included full-length albums from Loose Kaynon and AQ, MI , Blaqbonez immediately created a space despite his project competing with those of more seasoned rappers on the same label- MI Abaga’s Yung Denzel, and AQ and Loose Kaynon’s Crown.
The album peaked at number one on the iTunes chart, dusting his label mates and Falz’s Moral Instruction. But Blaqbonez knows he has not achieved cult status and is looking to become a mainstay in street culture.
“Right now, I feel my fan base is a selected group of people, it is only mostly posh audience. I don’t know if I got to like Mushin…if I perform there if they will know me. These are the places they call the street.”
Asked if that was not contradictory to his claim of being the best, he replied that he is the best, not the hottest.
His analysis of his audience is apt. His Bad Body Re-Up sits pretty at 46 on iTunes Hip Hop chant for Nigerian two steps above MI’s Rendevouz and twenty notches above his mentor’s critically acclaimed A Study on Self Worth.
‘Crazy Journey’
The idea of Blaqbonez is a child of happenstance. Emeka Akumefule did not even want to rap. But even in his teens, he already had the ears for how a good rap song should sound. That trained him into an armchair critic. Until that changed one day.
He was listening to the radio with his cousin when the song of a 12-year-old rapper came on. The cousin found the song good enough and challenged Blaqbonez to come up with his own lyrics.
He went into the room and came back a few minutes later with enough bars to do the verse. He has never looked back since then even when circumstance should have forced him out of the game.
“It was a crazy journey,” he said matter-of-factly. “I broke things.”
Barely 15, Blaqbonez, boasting of study book of rhymes, went to a studio. He broke the microphone before he could spit a bar. His hilarious recounting of the events of that day underscored his penchant to trivialise his setbacks.
“I don’t know maybe the guy’s mic stand was broken before and he just used me to make money. I was young,” he says laughing.
He had to go beg his parents to cough out N50,000 to replace the microphone.
Like many Nigerian parents, they were not thrilled by his fascination with music. They chalked it down to youthful exuberance that will fade out as he grows older. In fact, his father had already made a computer engineer out of him.
“Seeing your child go into something you don’t know if it will work out is serious… music can be ridiculous. People spend 10 years of their lives still chasing music. Sometimes, they can become successful after the 10 years. For some people, it is just a waste of their whole lives. That’s the fear of every parent.”
The initial unfortunate studio incident notwithstanding, Blaqbonez still went ahead to record a mixtape while he was a student of Computer Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University. His dream of dropping that mixtape died with a crashed hard drive of his producer’s laptop.
Before 2019, Blaqbonez held his own in the underground rap scenes. His pre-2019 journey is cluttered with a litany of singles and well-received mixtapes. As a gangly youth looking to break into the big time, he was not afraid to go head to head with the best of Nigerian rappers.
Like many rappers, he was not only discouraged by his parents, the entertainment industry was not exactly welcoming of rap either. But a few rap contests and cyphers provide aspiring rap artist with a platform to vent their frustrations via bars. Even at that, not many are guaranteed a moment in the spotlight.
Blaqbonez is one of the few lucky ones whose success at rap contest and cyphers morphed into industry acceptance. That success is a child of well-honed battling skills and a chance meeting MI Abaga.
MI himself is not a stranger to the hardship aspiring rappers face in a country that is most welcoming of Afrobeats. He told me a few days before the start of LAMBAugust that he wanted to provide guidance for a lot of young rap artists.
Blaq is a major beneficiary of that guidance.
By putting him on 100 Crowns which has AQ and Loose Kaynon, spitters of no mean status, Blaqbonez is able to get both mentorship and advice career direction.
“I’m the one who is getting the most benefits from the arrangement,” Blaqbonez said. “The clique helps. They are people that have been there, they’ve seen it all.
“Loose is an OG. Loose knows things. Sometimes, he tells you things that you will not understand at first. Having those guys around they see things from different perspectives.”
Those perspectives are apparently rubbing off well on him. His latest project B. R. I. A., designed to provoke conversations like LAMBAugust and MI’s Your Rappers Should Fix Your Life, is generating a lot of controversies and reply tracks.
B.R.I.A. is Blaqbonez at his gungho best and with that project comes a challenge:
“Any other rapper that wants to diss, save yourself some studio time, lets set it up live, real crowd real feelings, with real MONEY on the table. Plus you’d get to take your L right there and then and we move.”
Between his last mixtape and his debut LP, Blaqbonez morphed from gritty bar-for-bar rapper to a more rounded artist. In the future, he may consider going the Olamide way and embrace singing.
In fact, he is already training in that direction one of the two projects he is dropping before the end of the year will feature his alter ego, Mr Boombastic.
“Mr Boombastic is more of a dancehall artist. He’s groovy he bounces on the beat. The kind of flow my Mr Boombastic has is the groovy, vibey kind of flow,” Blaqbonez said.
For now he is contended with carrying the torch of Nigerian rap, and of course, clowning other rappers.
President Muhammadu Buhari as military head of state of Nigeria before his regime was truncated. PHOTO: William Campbell/Sygma/Corbis
Spokesman to President Muhammadu Buhari said The Punch newspaper is free to refer the president by his military rank.
“If you decide to call him Major General, he wasn’t dashed the rank, he earned it,” presidential spokesman Femi Adesina tweeted.
“So, you are not completely out of order. The fact that you can do so is even another testimony to press freedom in Nigeria.”
The Punch Newspaper in its Wednesday, December 11 editorial said that it will henceforth address the Nigerian President with his rank as a military dictator in the 80s- Buhari as Major General Buhari (retd).
“As a symbolic demonstration of our protest against autocracy and military-style repression, PUNCH (all our print newspapers, The PUNCH, Saturday PUNCH, Sunday PUNCH, PUNCH Sports Extra, and digital platforms, most especially Punchng.com) will henceforth prefix Buhari’s name with his rank as a military dictator in the 80s, Major General, and refer to his administration as a regime, until they purge themselves of their insufferable contempt for the rule of law,” The Punch said.
The Punch said her decision was in protest of serial disregard for human rights, court orders and the battering of other arms of government and Nigeria’s democratic institutions by the ‘Buhari regime’.
The national daily criticised the president for the continued detention of Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibrahim el-Zakzakky and his wife and former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki by agencies of the Nigerian government despite court orders granting them bail.
The Punch posited that ‘Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd)’ has sustained the ‘ham-fisted military junta’ attitude he used to overthrow a democratically elected Nigerian government in 1984.
“Under Buhari, the SSS has become a monstrous and repressive secret police, acting often with impunity…The Nigeria Police, whose notoriety predates Buhari’s second coming, has continued its serial abuse of human rights,” Punch said.
“Under the law, suspects cannot be held beyond 48 hours except by a court order. But the regime observes this in the breach.”
The national daily said some state governments in the country are also acting similarly to the ‘Buhari regime’ in disregarding human rights and court orders.
The Punch urged Nigerians to stop failing to act against oppression and learn to stand up for their rights through all peaceful and legal means, including the right to protest and of peaceful assembly.
Scientists, experts and scaling partners of the African Cassava Agronomy Initiative (ACAI) of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) are set for their fourth annual review and planning session.
This was contained in a statement issued by Mr Godwin Atser, the IITA Digital Extension and Advisory Services Specialist, and made available to journalists on Sunday in Ibadan.He said the aim of the meeting is to discuss and unveil the progress made in cassava agronomy and how such efforts had been addressing the low yield per hectare on farmers’ fields in Nigeria and Tanzania.He remarked that across Africa, yield per hectare of cassava was about nine tonnes per hectare as opposed to Asia with more than 20 tonnes.
This, he said, undermined African cassava farmers’ competitiveness in the export market.The statement quoted the ACAI Project Coordinator, Dr Pieter Pypers, as saying that the meeting was scheduled for Unguja Island in Zanzibar, Tanzania, from Dec. 9 to Dec. 12.
According to him, the meeting would present an opportunity for the entire ACAI team to get together, celebrate the successes of the project, discuss challenges and plan for the fifth year.He said that the meeting would also have less of plenary presentations but more of poster sessions, a world café, breakout sessions and information booths, where scientists, knowledge exchange experts and partners would showcase and share ideas.Pypers added that the meeting would also be about scaling and dissemination ﬁrst, and how the project had started gaining momentum with Akilimo.
According to him, Akilimo is the mobile agronomy advisory tool developed to serve as the face of ACAI’s decision support system.“It combines data, predictions models, software infrastructure and interfaces, using pragmatic and user-centered approaches to provide the information in ways that are attractive and useful to partners, extension workers and cassava farmers.
“Aside the ACAI team members, partners leading the dissemination of the ACAI Decision Support Tools through extension work in Nigeria and Tanzania expected at the meeting include Mennonite Economic Development Associates (MEDA), Farm Concern International (FCI), UWAMWIMA, Minjingu, Psaltry International, 2Scale and NOTORE.“The technical partners working to strengthen Akilimo (VIAMO 321 service, eSOKO digital solutions and Arifu chatbot) will also be present at booth sessions,” he said.

Lady Maiden Ibru walks in a few minutes later than scheduled apologizing profusely for “wasting our time” while insisting she “has to explain why she was late because we have been waiting.” “We are all humans and I can’t be keeping you waiting for long,” she says apologetically.
While a stranger might be taken by surprise at this gesture especially from a woman of her status, those who know her will readily admit that Maiden is just being Maiden.
Although she was ill only a day before, Lady Ibru has been up on her feet all day attending to meetings and has still made time for our photoshoot. Beaming with smiles on her face, she takes a pose….1, 2, an element of grace and action. Minutes later, her photoshoot is interrupted by a pleasant surprise: a bouquet from one of her sons, Tive, just to appreciate her.
Born and bred in Nigeria to a Greek father and a Nigerian mother, her mother took on the role as a super-parent after the death of her husband when Lady Ibru was only 8. “After the death of my father when I was just 8 and my brother, 10, Mum ensured we had the best and would take us to vacations. I had a happy childhood.”
Owing to her heritage, her skin tone easily gives her away. Yet Lady Ibru strongly identifies as Nigerian, particularly Yoruba. In fact, many a time, those who interact with her are left dazed because of how effortlessly the Yoruba language rolls off her tongue, sometimes, without a word in the English Language.
Nor will it ever again be described as a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom.
On the contrary, it will continue to be a perfect example of law and order and rapid development.
The launch on Friday, October 11 , of Operation Kpochapu 2, which saw the super smart Mobile Surveillance System (MSS) for the first time in Africa, the security situation can only continue to improve, and not deteriorate.
This is good for all because it will assist our people realize their vision of making their beloved state the first place investors will consider for business.

Three killed in Anambra beer parlour fire.
An early morning fire at a beer parlour in Nnewi, Anambra State, on Friday killed three female workers who were sleeping in the building.
The incident happened at Ezekwuabo Otolo Nnewi, close to St.
Thomas Anglican Church (Akwudo).
The fire started at the place, called Padded Joint, around 3:00 a.
m.
The source of the fire was yet to be ascertained at the time of this report.
A resident of the area, who asked not to be named, said that the owner of the motel is a woman fondly called ‘Obodo Umu Anumanu.
’.
The source said the owner closed the beer parlour where the three girls slept before leaving for her house the night before the fire outbreak.
The source said it is a normal occurrence for the owner to close the building and go home with the keys even if some of her staff slept over.
“The three girls could not escape because the rooms were locked and there was no way for them to exit as at that time,” the source said.
The corpses of the deceased have been deposited at the Nnewi Diocesan Hospital (Akwudo) by the police.
The police commissioner in the state, John Abang, confirmed the incident.
“It’s a drinking joint and the waiters who do sleep over in the joint lost their lives.
Very unfortunate”, he said.
Mr Abang said the owner of the joint has been arrested and has made useful statement to the police.
This is the third fire incident in 48 hours in Anambra State.
At least three persons died on Wednesday in a fire incident in Onitsha when a petrol tanker fell at Iweka road and caught fire which spread to nearby buildings and shops at Ochanja Market.
Among the dead were a mother and her daughter while the third victim was a trader at the popular Ochanja Market.
The second fire, which occurred on the Enugu-Onitsha highway on Friday morning, also involved a petrol tanker.
But luckily, no lives were lost.
Three killed in Anambra beer parlour fire.
The fire, however, destroyed many cars parked on the road near the scene of the incident.
Anambra Govt procures 10 fire engines.
Meanwhile, the Anambra State Government has moved to equip the state fire service by procuring 10 new fire engines from Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Ltd.
A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Willie Obiano on Communications, Ikenna Aniagboso, said the governor has also ordered the recruitment of 120 personnel for the state fire service.
The move followed criticisms that trailed Wednesday’s fire incident.
The state government was criticised by residents for its slow response to the petrol tanker fire.
Mr Aniagboso, in the statement, said the state government has also mapped out four plots of land at Umuokpu, Awka for the establishment of a federal fire station immediately.
“Government has also concluded arrangements for periodic training of the firemen to adequately prepare them for emergencies.
“The government of Anambra state remains committed to the safety and security of Ndi Anambra,” he said.
50 Political Parties' Queue Up Behind Ganduje After Controversial Kano Governorship Election.
Gaya, who spoke on behalf of other parties, said the elections were free, fair and credible, “with some insignificant and unavoidable hiccups that are natural for any election”.
About 50 political parties have lent their support to the reelection of Abdullahi Ganduje, Governor of Kano State, in the just-concluded governorship election.
This was contained in a media statement signed by Abba Anwar, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, and made available to the media on Wednesday.
The parties also dismissed a call by some parties for the cancellation of the result, stating that it was a “misconstrued approach and a mere defeatist standpoint by some elements that are not even regarded as serious politicians”.
According to the statement, the parties “expressed disgust that none of their parties that were included in the list of parties calling for the cancellation of Kano gubernatorial election result was contacted before putting them on the list”.
Among the parties that pitched tent with Ganduje are AAP, UPC, ADC, NAC, NEPP, NUP, RPN, AD, SDP, ACD, NRM, and APM.
Gaya, who spoke on behalf of other parties, said the elections were free, fair and credible, “with some insignificant and unavoidable hiccups that are natural for any election”.
“It was even reported by Deputy Inspector of Police Anthony Michael in one of his live interviews with Channels TV when the election was on, that it was peaceful and there was no reported case of thuggery," he said.
He added that even accredited election observers such as Ibrahim Baba (mni) testified to that.     As such we are therefore supporting the outcome of the election at whatever length.     Ours is to now continue giving our helping hand for him to succeed again in developing the state.     .
Ganduje won the Kano State governorship election, polling 1,033,695 votes against 1,024,713 votes secured by Abba Yusuf of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP), meaning he won with aslim margin of 8,982 votes.
However, the election was marred by incidents of violence and voter intimidation and disenfranchisement, underage voting and ballot box snatching.
900 Trucks With Paid Duties Of N3.
6bn Stuck At Seme Border.
Igbowu said the group of traders had lost over N5bn due to the government’s policy.
Nigeria-Seme border completely closed.
AYODELE ADENIRAN.
An association of fish and coconut farmers has said that 900 of their trucks have been grounded at the Seme Border after paying excise duties of N4m each – N3.
6bn in total.
Chairman of the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents and Coconut/Fish Farmers Union, Samuel Igbowu, said the goods had been secured before the partial border closure was enforced, according to a report by PUNCH.
Igbowu said the group of traders had lost over N5bn due to the government’s policy.
He said, “A single truck paid over N4m as customs duty and we have over 900 trucks.
“We are pleading to the government to please allow those that have paid duty to go in and deliver to our warehouses.
We are losing money day in day out.     Bank loan is there and interest is accumulating on a daily basis.     ”.     The agric produce traders were protesting at the scene of a visit by a Federal Government delegation to the Seme Border.     Igbowu added, We have paid the normal customs duty and we have all the documents processed.
They have been trapped here for over three months now, they did not allow them to go in.     We cannot sell and we cannot return the money we borrowed.

Accident Victims Dying At Clinic Doors For Lack Of Police Reports By Saidat Akanbi.
Few months ago in Lagos, a young lady, Ruth, was run into by a speeding car.
She was rushed to the nearest hospital with hopes that she would be saved.
That hospital turned her down, not because she was dead already, but because she didn't have a police report.
The good Samaritans pleaded to no avail, the hospital wouldn't take her.
The young lady died before she could make it to another hospital.
What does one do when institutions entrusted with our very lives betray that trust in one's most vulnerable moment?.
Few months ago in Lagos, a young lady, Ruth, was run into by a speeding car.
She was rushed to the nearest hospital with hopes that she would be saved.
That hospital turned her down, not because she was dead already, but because she didn't have a police report.
The good Samaritans pleaded to no avail, the hospital wouldn't take her.
The young lady died before she could make it to another hospital.
For many people like me, it is difficult to draw the link between police reports and accident victims.
Why should a police report be needed before an accident victim would seek care? On the other hand, the requirement of police reports before gunshot victims can access healthcare is more popular, though wrongfully so.
Is it ethically right to allow a man die for mere lack of a police report? Should hospitals not accept and treat every patient in need? Treat, save a life first and ask questions later? Even a criminal’s life is worth saving, if not for anything but the wealth of intelligence it holds.
In 2017, Nigeria took a bold step to introduce the National Gunshot Act which was set to turn things around.
The Act stipulates compulsory treatment and care of gunshot victims, regardless of money and police report.
Unfortunately, two years after many hospitals, particularly private clinics still reject such victims.
In fact, the police report prerequisite seems to have extended to victims of road traffic accidents.
It is easy to surmise that clinic owners and health care workers are callous and inhumane, or why else would they turn victims away? A reactionary measure that many people have suggested is for healthcare regulatory agencies to come forth and enforce punitive measures against such hospitals that are apparently flouting a national policy.
In my opinion, that would be superficial and ineffective.
If the country is truly willing to solve this problem, a thorough root cause analysis is necessary to understand prevailing circumstances and proffer practical solutions.
In an emergency, the first responsibility of any healthcare worker is to save a life.
Even without a national policy to #TreatFirstQuestionsLater, the natural reaction of any healthcare worker is expected to be to save the patient.
And that is what many clinics do.
But they have landed in trouble many times for doing so.
Police officers are known to visit such clinics, harass, extort and sometimes arrest the clinic staff.
Hence, clinic managers appear to have set an unwritten counter-policy against receiving such victims that may cause police hassles.
Every staff on duty tries to protect her job and means of livelihood by making sure not to admit such victims.
That is not the only scenario where clinics and their staff face harassments.
They face threats and violence from ruffians too.
If a ruffian who suffered injury during a gang fight dies in a clinic, other members of his gang may decide to rough-handle the staff.
If a popular person dies in your clinic, you may be in trouble.
Some years back, when an Ibadan political celebrity died in the Accidents and Emergency room of the University College Hospital, healthcare workers had to hurriedly remove wardcoats and uniforms because his thugs became violent against anyone they recognised as such.
In fact, there are several reported instances of clinics facing near demolitions and property destruction from ruffians.
Beyond police reports, the Act stipulates treating victims 'regardless of money'.
Clinic owners and healthcare workers have often wondered how practicable this is especially in Nigeria where there is very little health insurance coverage.
The recurrent question is: if I treat such patients, who will pay the bills? While many of them take the risk to nevertheless accept and treat such patients, others bitterly recount instances where such patients and their relatives refuse to pay (or have difficulties paying) when the patient became stable.
While all these may sound exonerative, they are in no way justifications for a victim to not be able to access care when they need it, especially in their most vulnerable period.
That hospital betrayed Ruth.
The healthcare system, Police Force and Nigeria betrayed Ruth.
And no one is safe, until every one is safe.
Few weeks after Ruth's case in Lagos, Jemima died after being turned down for lack of police report by a hospital in Jos.
Through November, a #TreatFirstQuestionsLater campaign was launched (initiated by Caleb Somtochukwu), and a petition signed by thousands of Nigerians.
That petition has now been forwarded to the National Assembly.
In a few days, the world will celebrate the Universal Health Coverage Day.
But only when everyone is truly able to access quality care, every time they need it, can Nigeria boast of Universal Health Coverage.
It is not about what exists in policy documents, it’s about what we do every time to everyone, anyone, irrespective of how they come.
It is important that all stakeholders are made aware of on-ground realities, understand root causes, and reach practical agreement for a standard operating procedure that would truly give access to victims and patients in their moment of dire need.
To mark the upcoming Universal Health Coverage Day on December 12, a non-profit initiative, Afara 360 is holding a first-of-its kind roundtable event that will bring together high-level stakeholders and influencers from healthcare, government, Police Force, health law, and the media, as well as victims' relatives to decisively deliberate on the steps for actual implementation of the written policy document.

Activist Tackles FUNAAB VC Over Expulsion Of Student Following Facebook Post.
Adewale in an open letter on Facebook to the Vice Chancellor of FUNAAB, had raised some pertinent questions over the incessant robbery of students’ hostels, indiscriminate arrest of undergraduates, and also the lack of adequate transportation system on the school's main campus.
Rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, have reacted to the recent expulsion of a 200-level student-activist of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Ifemosu Adewale.
Adewale in an open letter on Facebook to the Vice Chancellor of FUNAAB, had raised some pertinent questions over the incessant robbery of students’ hostels, indiscriminate arrest of undergraduates, and also the lack of adequate transportation system on the school's main campus.
Angered by the said letter, FUNAAB’s management expelled Adewale, claiming that he had breached the school’s moral code.
Condemning the expulsion of the student, Adeyanju said, “Dear Vice Chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, why did you expel Michael Ifemosu for writing an open letter urging you to look into the incessant robbery of FUNAAB students and the worsening welfare of students in the last two years?”.
Speaking with SaharaReporters, Adewale said he sees his expulsion by FUNAAB's management and the Vice Chancellor as a witch-hunt due to his relationship with Omoyele Sowore, the #RevolutionNow Movement, his previous letter to the Inspector-General of Police, and his consistent activism to bring about the development of the university community that is prone to incessant armed-robbery attacks.
He said, “The allegations against me is based on my alliance with Sowore and the #RevolutionNow Movement I was told by high-ranking officials within the university management.
“There was an open letter I wrote to the Inspector-General of Police on the incessant armed-robbery within the university community.
“So, I was secretly told that my expulsion is also linked to that letter, due to the fact that my letter almost got Ogun State Commissioner of Police removed.
“I was told that there was a publication made by SaharaReporters concerning the incessant robbery in FUNAAB, hence the school management felt I was definitely the one who gave the report to SaharaReporters due to my alliance with Sowore.

Activities of Transgenders Like Bobrisky Despicable, Says Women Group.
She said, “It is regrettable and strange for Bobrisky to publicly declare that has 24 boy-friends in high places.
The National Council for Women Societies has described transgender activities in the country as “despicable and offensive”.                   
The group made the comment in a statement signed by its National President NCWS, Gloria Shada.                   
Shada said that Nigerian women find the promotion of despicable conducts such as nudity and transgender activities as done by Bobrisky whose real name is Idris Okuneye, very offensive.                   
She said, “It is regrettable and strange for Bobrisky to publicly declare that has 24 boy-friends in high places.                   
“Rise up to stop this evil before it destroys our children and the future of our nation.”                   
She said the activities of the cross-dresser is “alien” to our culture and should be stopped to preserve Nigeria’s cultural heritage.                   
Recall that the police in Lagos on Saturday shut a venue where a lavish birthday party was to be held for Bobrisky.                   
Bobrisky, who clocked 28 on Saturday, had slated the celebration for two locations in Lagos with one to hold and another for Sunday.                   
The event was supposed to have held at Pearls Gardens in Lekki Phase 1 and Paradise Boat Club, Victoria Island. 
The incident came shortly after Director-General of the Nigerian Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Segun Runsewe, warned Bobrisky to desist from engaging in acts that runs rubbishes Nigeria’s rich culture.                  
Runsewe had said, “Bobrisky is a national disgrace.                   
He started by selling and using bleaching creams, now, he has grown boobs, bums and hips.                  
If a Bobrisky is doing well with his immoral lifestyle, how do you convince Nigerian youths to do the right thing? "If we don’t address Bobrisky as early as possible, he will form a team that will spread like wildfire.

Enrique temporarily stepped down in June to spend time with his family and take care of his sick daughter, Xana, who eventually died in August of bone cancer.                  
The assistant coach, Robert Moreno, had been in charge of the team, guiding them through the Euro 2020 qualification.                  
“Today we can confirm Luis Enrique returns to his position of work,” RFEF President, Luis Rubiales, said in a press conference at the national team’s training base in Las Rozas.                  
Rubiales said Enrique has a contract until the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and that it will be up to him whether Moreno is offered a chance to resume his previous role as assistant coach.                  
“Luis Enrique stepped down because of the worst possible thing that can happen to a father,” Rubiales said.                  
“He has always been the leader of our project and he has a contract until (the) World Cup in Qatar,” he added.                  
Enrique succeeded Vicente Del Bosque as national team boss following Spain's exit from the 2018 World Cup in the last 16.                  
After Weeks Of Shoddy Performances, Everton Finally Sacks Silva.                  
The management of the club took the decision to relief Silva of his job after they were pummelled by city rivals – Liverpool – on Wednesday 5-2, leaving them languishing in the relegation zone on the league table.                   
English Premier League side, Everton, have finally sacked manager, Marco Silva, after 18 months, which brought some of the worst results for the club.                   
The management of the club took the decision to relief Silva of his job after they were pummelled by city rivals – Liverpool – on Wednesday 5-2, leaving them languishing in the relegation zone on the league table.                   
Silva won 24 and lost 24 of his 60 games after taking charge of the team in May 2018.                   
Everton are now searching for their fourth permanent boss since Roberto Martinez was sacked in May 2016.                   
Former manager, David Moyes, has been considered as a potential interim successor, but the suggestion has sparked a largely negative reaction from supporters.                   
Aisha Buhari’s Unending Drama Amidst Nigerian Child’s Plight By Olabisi Deji-Folutile.                   
For those who have taken time to study the First Lady, her own special modus operandi is maximising a public speaking engagement to her advantage.                   When Mrs. Buhari hinted last week that her husband’s spokespersons were not doing their job well, I knew she was about to release another bombshell.                   She did not disappoint.                   
Part of the statement she personally signed on Wednesday indicted Garba Shehu, a presidential spokesperson, who she accused of telling Nigerians that there would be no office of the First Lady in 2015without her husband’s instruction.                   
She claimed Shehu took orders from Mamman Daura, her husband’s influential nephew, who does not hold any official position in this administration.                   
For that reason and many others more, she thinks Shehu is no longer fit to be her husband’s spokesperson.

If President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Aisha, devotes half of the energy invested in fighting the cabal in Aso Rock to pressing for the welfare of the Nigerian child, perhaps, there could have been a significant reduction in the number of the over 13 million out-of-school children in the country.                   
This could also have probably led to a drastic reduction in the number of child brides in the country – the highest in Africa.                   
I am not saying this out of spite but in recognition of the First Lady’s strong convictions and immense political sagacity.                   
She knows how to grab Nigerians’ attention at will.                   
She knows what to say, when to talk and the appropriate channel to utilise in passing her message across.                   
She was, for instance, the first to tell Nigerians that her husband was not in control of his government.                   
She also threatened that she might not support him for a second term in office if things continued the way they were.                   
Somehow, she succeeds in attracting some sympathy from Nigerians even when it was glaring that her complaints are centered around herself, family and personal interests.                   
Some of us can still remember how the All Progressives Congress set up a parallel campaign body with the First Lady being in charge of one prior to the 2019 presidential election and how Aisha recently went to Kogi State to beg the people to re-elect a governor that had not paid workers’ salaries for years.                   
For those who have taken time to study the First Lady, her own special modus operandi is maximising a public speaking engagement to her advantage.                  
When Mrs. Buhari hinted last week that her husband’s spokespersons were not doing their job well, I knew she was about to release another bombshell.

For that reason and many others more, she thinks Shehu is no longer fit to be her husband’s spokesperson.                   
I, however, find the First Lady’s latest outburst on scrapping the position of the First Lady amusing.                   
Isn’t that was what her husband and party promised to do ahead of the presidential election in 2015? This was a major selling point during the “Change campaign” that ushered in Buhari’s administration.                   
The President clearly stated that the office of the First Lady was not in the constitution.                   
Buhari, in an interview he granted to Weekly Trust in December 2014 (though the web page is no longer available) had categorically stated that he would not have an office of the First Lady.                   
He said the Ministry of Women Affairs should be allowed to play its role unhindered.                   
In another interview with the Premium Times in 2014, Aisha had also promised to adhere to what the constitution stipulates, saying, “When my husband is elected as the president of this country, he will rule the country within the rule of law based on the constitution of the country.                   
If the office of the First Lady is constitutionally recognised, he will not tamper with it, but if it is not that’s okay.                   
“For me, I will perform my duties and role as the wife of the President of Nigeria traditionally.                   
Wives of presidents have some traditional roles, like receiving guests, visiting orphanages, helping the less privileged people.                   
They also lead in the fight for the right of women and malnourished children, infant mortality rate, kidnapping and girl-child trafficking.                                   
We all know that going by the provisions of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, there is no mention of the office of the First Lady or wife of the President as the case may be in the constitution.                   
Yet, this government never scrapped the office.                   
Rather, President Buhari merely changed the title of the office from the First Lady to Wife of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria in his first term.                   
Just as under other administrations, Aisha’s office has always been occupied by staff members, aides, security details and protocol officials, attached to her.                   
In 2019, the office was officially designated as the Office of the First Lady through the pronouncement of Aisha herself.                   
While changing her title, she said it was her choice not to be called the First Lady and that she had changed her mind.                   
That’s governance in Nigeria for you!.                   
After all said and done, I find it confusing that Mrs Buhari could still publicly accuse her husband’s aide of scrapping the office of the First Lady through someone, other than her husband’s instruction.                   
That sounds like an insult on the collective intelligence of Nigerians.                   
From Aisha’s latest statement, it seems most things she and her husband said before the 2015 elections were carefully crafted to deceive gullible Nigerians for electoral gains.                   
For me, I don’t see a big deal in retaining or scrapping the office of a first lady.                   
Neither does the absence of such office distress any reasonable Nigerian woman as claimed by Aisha.                   
I think Nigerian women are more interested in seeing a President’s wife that can use her influence to touch the lives of the downtrodden, the oppressed and the forgotten in the society.                   
Wife of one of Nigeria’s former vice presidents, Mrs Titilayo Atiku, once used her Women Trafficking and Child Labour Eradication project to wage war against forced prostitution and other forms of human trafficking in the country.                   
Her pet project was more popular than that of the late First Lady, Mrs Stella Obasanjo, because it touched on a core problem in the Nigerian society then.                      
When will Mrs Buhari begin to talk passionately about child marriage, the burgeoning out-of-school children population in the country and other plights of the Nigerian child as she does about the activities of her husband’s kinsmen in Aso Rock? We need a strong voice like hers to draw national and global  attention to the plight of these kids on continuous basis.        
This goes beyond making political statements once in a while.                  
Instead of the unending drama of bringing her family’s battle to the court of Nigerians all the time, Mrs Buhari should use her power and position to draw the attention of wealthy Nigerians to the problem of school children still learning under trees in Nigeria.                   
The honest truth is that the disloyalty of a presidential aide to his boss cannot pass for a Nigeria’s problem? The President elected the aide and he has the power to sack him.                   
Aisha should know how to get her husband to do that.                              
If she cannot, too bad! Some of us are tired of the endless drama coming from the first family’s abode.                   
It is no longer entertaining.                   
It is becoming increasingly boring.                   
Nigerians need some breathing space.                   
We want something more refreshing from the office of the First Lady.                   
Going forward, I expect Mrs Buhari to use the resources at her disposal to influence policies that will stop child marriage in Nigeria and improve learning environments for children.                   
She could use her privileged position as a Northerner, who is educated, to push for girl-child education in the North.                  
The region harbours the highest number of child brides in the country.                   
She can work with state governments towards domesticating the Child Rights Act passed by the Federal Government of Nigeria in 2003.                   
Currently, 11 states, mainly in the North, are yet to domesticate this law.                       
Interestingly, Adamawa, the home state of Mrs Buhari, is one of such states.                   
Others are Sokoto, Kano, Zamfara, Kaduna, Jigawa, Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe, Borno and Gombe.                   
It would be unfortunate if after spending eight years in office as First Lady; Mrs Buhari fails to influence these 11 Northern states to domesticate the Child Rights Act.                   
The Child Rights Convention was adopted 30 years ago by the United Nations General Assembly.
